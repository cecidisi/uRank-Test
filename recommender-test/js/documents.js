By using robots to apply novel force fields to the arm, investigators are gaining insight into how the nervous system models its external dynamic environment. The nervous system builds internal models gradually by experience and uses them in combination with impedance and feedback control strategies. Internal models are robust to environmental and neural noise, generalized across space, implemented in multiple brain regions, and developed in childhood. Robots are also being used to assist in repetitive movement practice following neurologic injury, providing insight into movement recovery. Robots can haptically assess sensorimotor performance, administer training, quantify amount of training, and improve motor recovery. In addition to providing insight into motor control, robotic paradigms may eventually enhance motor learning and rehabilitation beyond the levels possible with conventional training techniques.","collectionName":"Annual review of biomedical engineering","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2004"},"index":4,"keywords":{"motor":27.40840023925201,"robot":21.922828908080685,"train":16.443305337512,"recoveri":16.442958255889586,"control":16.442437558153312,"neurolog":10.965440179091631,"injuri":10.964053697233679,"movem":10.961798612212247,"system":10.961379470118368,"sensorimotor":5.482720089545816,"childhood":5.482720089545816,"imped":5.482026848616839,"brain":5.481680047850402,"light":5.481471909645883,"paradigm":5.481471909645883,"rehabilit":5.481333126771467,"nois":5.481333126771467,"intern":5.4812339843533024,"arm":5.481159621088721,"combin":5.481159621088721,"space":5.481017639498762,"health":5.481017639498762,"forc":5.480959384809243,"practic":5.480916662546665,"devic":5.4808993061061235,"region":5.48084723497695,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"environment":5.480751529614279,"experi":5.480748566453773,"human":5.480710759842148,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"7495ea04-aa4e-3a6b-9a6c-4161d4f28ea6","title":"The evolution of robotics research","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evolution-robotics-research/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evolution-robotics-research/","creator":"Elena Garcia, Maria Antonia Jimenez, Pablo Gonzalez De Santos, Manuel Armada","description":"This article surveys traditional research topics in industrial robotics and mobile robotics and then expands on new trends in robotics research that focus more on the interaction between human and robot.

Two questions are considered in this paper: what and when to communicate. To answer these questions, we developed a human-robot communication framework which makes use of common probabilistic robotics representations. The data stored in the representation determines what to communicate, and probabilistic inference mechanisms determine when to communicate. One application domain of the framework is collaborative human-robot decision making: robots use decision theory to select actions based on perceptual information gathered from their sensors and human operators. In this paper, operators are regarded as remotely located, valuable information sources which need to be managed carefully. Robots decide when to query operators using Value-Of-Information theory, i.e. humans are only queried if the expected benefit of their observation exceeds the cost of obtaining it. This can be seen as a mechanism for adjustable autonomy whereby adjustments are triggered at run-time based on the uncertainty in the robots' beliefs related to their task. This semi-autonomous system is demonstrated using a navigation task and evaluated by a user study. Participants navigated a robot in simulation using the proposed system and via classical teleoperation. Results show that our system has a number of advantages over teleoperation with respect to performance, operator workload, usability, and the users' perception of the robot. We also show that despite these advantages, teleoperation may still be a preferable driving mode depending on the mission priorities.

There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry. One outcome of this discussion is that it is important to view the design and evaluation problem from the robot's perspective as well as that of the human. Taken as a whole, this paper provides a framework with which to design and evaluate sociable robots from a HRI perspective.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2004"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":49.32636504318154,"hri":27.406665633857337,"perspect":21.92422201290883,"human":21.92284303936859,"interact":16.44230736959687,"hci":10.964053697233679,"autonom":10.9616944699539,"comput":10.961575443589524,"way":5.482720089545816,"inquiri":5.482720089545816,"creatur":5.482720089545816,"similar":5.482026848616839,"partner":5.481680047850402,"desktop":5.481680047850402,"topic":5.481333126771467,"lik":5.481159621088721,"tool":5.480916662546665,"social":5.4808373163592075,"technologi":5.480738124770573}},{"id":"14053480-ecd3-3374-9566-b78c137cb516","title":"Theory and evaluation of human robot interactions","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/theory-evaluation-human-robot-interactions-20/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/theory-evaluation-human-robot-interactions-20/","creator":"Jean Scholtz","description":"Human-robot interaction (HRI) for mobile robots is still in its infancy. Most user interactions with robots have been limited to tele-operation capabilities where the most common interface provided to the user has been the video feed from the robotic platform and some way of directing the path of the robot. Control systems exhibit autonomy and cognition, and which operate in changing, real-world environments. In addition For mobile robots with semi-autonomous capabilities, the user is also provided with a means of setting way points. More importantly, most HRI capabilities have been developed by robotics experts for use by robotics experts. As robots increase in capabilities and are able to perform more tasks in an autonomous manner we need to think about the interactions that humans will have with robots and what software architecture and user interface designs can accommodate the human in-the-loop. We also need to design systems that can be used by domain experts but not robotics experts. This paper outlines a theory interaction and proposes the interactions of human-robot and information needed by both humans and robots for the different levels of interaction, including an evaluation methodology based on situational awareness.","collectionName":"36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003.

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.","collectionName":"2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2009","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":60.287779497221884,"human":27.403553799210737,"subject":21.924407116682666,"behavior":21.92383753923697,"interact":21.923076492795822,"gender":21.923018629541158,"persuasion":10.965440179091631,"hri":10.962666253542935,"social":10.961674632718415,"humanoid":10.961598333825123,"persuas":5.482720089545816,"boston":5.482720089545816,"donat":5.482720089545816,"appeal":5.482720089545816,"engag":5.482720089545816,"belief":5.482026848616839,"prefer":5.482026848616839,"trust":5.482026848616839,"museum":5.482026848616839,"manner":5.482026848616839,"request":5.481680047850402,"monei":5.481680047850402,"sex":5.481680047850402,"questnair":5.481471909645883,"core":5.481471909645883,"act":5.481333126771467,"post":5.481333126771467,"appear":5.4812339843533024,"agent":5.4812339843533024,"scienc":5.481017639498762,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"chang":5.480793232423387,"man":5.480748566453773,"work":5.480729498950042,"woman":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"9042dc56-5cd2-3148-9d81-c1c97e24fd20","title":"A survey of socially interactive robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-socially-interactive-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-socially-interactive-robots/","creator":"Terrence Fong, Illah Nourbakhsh, Kerstin Dautenhahn","description":"This paper reviews \"socially interactive robots\": robots for which social human-robot interaction is important.

Storytelling requires that the humanoid robot be aware of its audience and able to direct its gaze in a natural way. In this paper, we explore how human gaze can be modeled and implemented on a humanoid robot to create a natural, human-like behavior for storytelling. Our gaze model integrates data collected from a human storyteller and a discourse structure model developed by Cassell and her colleagues for human-like conversational agents (1994). We used this model to direct the gaze of a humanoid robot, Honda's ASIMO, as he recited a Japanese fairy tale using a pre-recorded human voice. We assessed the efficacy of this gaze algorithm by manipulating the frequency of ASIMO's gaze between two participants and used pre and post questionnaires to assess whether participants evaluated the robot more positively and did better on a recall task when ASIMO looked at them more. We found that participants performed significantly better in recalling ASIMO's story when the robot looked at them more. Our results also showed significant differences in how men and women evaluated ASIMO based on the frequency of gaze they received from the robot.

Used together, these modalities lead to effective teaching and learning approaches, respectively. In the robotics domain, task teaching has been mostly addressed by using only one or very few of these interactions. In this paper we present an approach for teaching robots that relies on the key features and the general approach people use when teaching each other: first give a demonstration, then allow the learner to refine the acquired capabilities by practicing under the teacher's supervision, involving a small number of trials. Depending on the quality of the learned task, the teacher may either demonstrate it again or provide specific feedback during the learner's practice trial for further refinement. Also, as people do during demonstrations, the teacher can provide simple instructions and informative cues, increasing the performance of learning. Thus, instructive demonstrations, generalization over multiple demonstrations and practice trials are essential features for a successful human-robot teaching approach. We implemented a system that enables all these capabilities and validated these concepts with a Pioneer 2DX mobile robot learning tasks from multiple demonstrations and teacher feedback.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the Second International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent systems - AAMAS '03","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2003"},"index":4,"keywords":{"demonstr":32.89008028710241,"teacher":27.410134243084197,"task":27.403825889988997,"robot":27.403536135100858,"learner":16.448160268637448,"capabl":10.962111006454416,"practic":10.96183332509333,"featur":10.961767982699179,"interact":10.961538246397911,"human":10.961421519684295,"dx":5.482720089545816,"pioneer":5.482720089545816,"modal":5.482720089545816,"supervis":5.482026848616839,"refin":5.482026848616839,"instruct":5.481680047850402,"cue":5.481333126771467,"natur":5.481017639498762,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"mobil":5.4808839913495895,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"present":5.4807239537404095,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"4ef8d4ea-8b4a-379d-85af-91b929ffdc57","title":"Can robots be teammates?: Benchmarks in human–robot teams.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/robots-teammates-benchmarks-humanrobot-teams/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/robots-teammates-benchmarks-humanrobot-teams/","creator":"Victoria Groom, Clifford Nass","description":"The team has become a popular model to organize joint human–robot behavior.

In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Robots have been proposed as a way to assist people to stay healthy and safe in their own homes. However, despite the need for such assistive devices and the success of some healthcare robots, other robots have had a poor response. This article reviews the literature about human responses to healthcare robots and summarises the variables that have been found to influence responses. It may be possible to increase acceptance of healthcare robots by properly assessing the needs of the human user and then matching the robot’s role, appearance and behaviour to these needs. Because robots have limitations in their abilities, another way to increase acceptance may be to modify the expectations of users to better match robots’ abilities. More research needs to investigate potential users’ needs and expectations in specific situations and whether interventions to increase the match between robot and human can increase acceptance.","collectionName":"International Journal of Social Robotics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":49.32636504318154,"healthcar":27.410134243084197,"accept":21.928107394467357,"increas":21.923481512143074,"human":16.442132279526444,"respon":10.964053697233679,"popul":10.963360095700803,"expect":10.962467968706605,"abil":10.9616944699539,"user":10.961515927750867,"strain":5.482720089545816,"users":5.482720089545816,"summaris":5.482026848616839,"match":5.481680047850402,"assist":5.481471909645883,"robots":5.481471909645883,"behaviour":5.481333126771467,"intervent":5.481333126771467,"direct":5.4812339843533024,"appear":5.4812339843533024,"success":5.481159621088721,"home":5.481017639498762,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"devic":5.4808993061061235,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"role":5.480761464853082}},{"id":"8846edd2-db8d-3315-a690-6482ef02c323","title":"Surgical robotics","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/surgical-robotics-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/surgical-robotics-1/","creator":"Ron Alterovitz, Jaydev P.

Since the first reported robotic surgical procedure two decades ago, surgical robotics has grown into more than a half billion dollar a year industry, and robots are now being used in thousands of surgical procedures each year. One especially successful commercial robot, Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci system for laparoscopic procedures, has been installed worldwide in more than 1,000 locations. This growth is a direct result of the promise of surgical robots to improve patient care. Integration of robot hardware with computer-integrated surgical systems has the potential to enable precise, targeted, minimally invasive medical interventions. Robotic devices are enabling physicians to perform procedures with reduced trauma, less blood loss, fewer errors, and faster patient recovery than would otherwise be possible. Robotics technology can also enhance the effectiveness of clinical procedures by coupling information sources such as medical images to actions in the operating room.","collectionName":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":43.84565781616137,"procur":27.40550889585333,"surgic":16.448160268637448,"patient":10.962943819291766,"growth":10.961798612212247,"system":10.961379470118368,"da":5.482720089545816,"blood":5.482720089545816,"trauma":5.482720089545816,"vinci":5.482720089545816,"dollar":5.482720089545816,"laparoscop":5.482720089545816,"thousand":5.482026848616839,"promis":5.482026848616839,"explosion":5.482026848616839,"physician":5.482026848616839,"loss":5.481471909645883,"room":5.481333126771467,"billion":5.481333126771467,"intervent":5.481333126771467,"error":5.4812339843533024,"hardwar":5.4812339843533024,"care":5.4812339843533024,"integr":5.481017639498762,"action":5.481017639498762,"recoveri":5.480986085296529,"devic":5.4808993061061235,"locat":5.4808839913495895,"imag":5.4808200663548945,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"industri":5.480729498950042,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"fd94ceab-f501-3b11-9608-e531281436c9","title":"Prediction of human behavior in human-robot interaction using psychological scales for anxiety and negative attitudes toward robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/prediction-human-behavior-human-robot-interaction-using-psychological-scales-anxiety-negative-attitu/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/prediction-human-behavior-human-robot-interaction-using-psychological-scales-anxiety-negative-attitu/","creator":"Tatsuya Nomura, Takayuki Kanda, Tomohiro Suzuki, Kensuke Kato","description":"When people interact with communication robots in daily life, their attitudes and emotions toward the robots affect their behavior.

This has resulted in interaction and actuation which is characteristic for machines. When constructing adaptive LEGO robots, we take another view, namely that the robot should resemble a human (or a biological creature) rather than a machine. This has implications on the interaction, actuation and control of the robot. I describe how the robot-as-human approach is investigated in a number of LEGO Mindstorms robot applications. These include making facial expressions, which allows a LEGO robot to express internal &amp;ldquo;moods&amp;rdquo;, and thereby we might achieve a better human-robot interaction. Another application is the Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot. The Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot's control is based on a modular behaviour system, where a number of the modules are evolved neural networks. Further, the Adaptive LEGO Pet Robot has a number of internal drives such as restlessness and hunger, which allow the robot to react on the internal drives.

Examples range from autonomous helicopters to Roomba, the robot vacuum cleaner. In this book, George Bekey offers an introduction to the science and practice of autonomous robots that can be used both in the classroom and as a reference for industry professionals. He surveys the hardware implementations of more than 300 current systems, reviews some of their application areas, and examines the underlying technology, including control, architectures, learning, manipulation, grasping, navigation, and mapping. Living systems can be considered the prototypes of autonomous systems, and Bekey explores the biological inspiration that forms the basis of many recent developments in robotics. He also discusses robot control issues and the design of control architectures. After an overview of the field that introduces some of its fundamental concepts, the book presents background material on hardware, control (from both biological and engineering perspectives), software architecture, and robot intelligence. It then examines a broad range of implementations and applications, including locomotion (wheeled, legged, flying, swimming, and crawling robots), manipulation (both arms and hands), localization, navigation, and mapping. The many case studies and specific applications include robots built for research, industry, and the military, among them underwater robotic vehicles, walking machines with four, six, and eight legs, and the famous humanoid robots Cog, Kismet, ASIMO, and QRIO. The book concludes with reflections on the future of robotics -- the potential benefits as well as the possible dangers that may arise from large numbers of increasingly intelligent and autonomous robots.","collectionName":"Communication","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":60.287779497221884,"autonom":32.8850834098617,"control":32.884875116306624,"architectur":16.443701953059907,"system":16.442069205177553,"inspir":10.965440179091631,"bekei":10.965440179091631,"hardwar":10.962467968706605,"manipul":10.962203558341333,"machin":10.962035278997524,"navig":10.96183332509333,"industri":10.961458997900085,"perspectives":5.482720089545816,"cog":5.482720089545816,"classroom":5.482720089545816,"hands":5.482720089545816,"vacuum":5.482720089545816,"roomba":5.482720089545816,"helicopt":5.482720089545816,"kismet":5.482720089545816,"qrio":5.482720089545816,"reflect":5.482720089545816,"georg":5.482026848616839,"danger":5.481680047850402,"vehicl":5.481680047850402,"from":5.481680047850402,"refer":5.481471909645883,"asimo":5.481471909645883,"leg":5.481471909645883,"robots":5.481471909645883,"intellig":5.481471909645883,"locomot":5.481471909645883,"profession":5.481333126771467,"prototyp":5.481333126771467,"local":5.481333126771467,"engineering":5.481333126771467,"softwar":5.481159621088721,"background":5.481159621088721,"arm":5.481159621088721,"scienc":5.481017639498762,"practic":5.480916662546665,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"materi":5.480799166912561,"humanoid":5.480799166912561,"task":5.4807651779977995,"develop":5.480740544194678,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"world":5.480727571894862,"human":5.480710759842148}},{"id":"1eaeb7ea-0381-357d-b836-daa8028d4a33","title":"Human-robot interaction in rescue robotics","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/humanrobot-interaction-rescue-robotics/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/humanrobot-interaction-rescue-robotics/","creator":"Robin Roberson Murphy","description":"Rescue robotics has been suggested by a recent DARPA/NSF study as an application domain for the research in human-robot integration (HRI). This paper provides a short tutorial on how robots are currently used in urban search and rescue (USAR) and discusses the HRI issues encountered over the past eight years. A domain theory of the search activity is formulated. The domain theory consists of two parts: 1) a workflow model identifying the major tasks, actions, and roles in robot-assisted search (e.g., a workflow model) and 2) a general information flow model of how data from the robot is fused by various team members into information and knowledge. The information flow model also captures the types of situation awareness needed by each agent in the rescue robot system. The article presents a synopsis of the major HRI issues in reducing the number of humans it takes to control a robot, maintaining performance with geographically distributed teams with intermittent communications, and encouraging acceptance within the existing social structure.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2004"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":43.84565781616137,"rescu":21.926720191401607,"hri":16.443999380314402,"inform":16.442166759609886,"human":16.442132279526444,"workflow":10.965440179091631,"flow":10.961872996219695,"team":10.961872996219695,"synopsi":5.482720089545816,"usar":5.482720089545816,"tutori":5.482720089545816,"nsf":5.482026848616839,"accept":5.482026848616839,"darpa":5.482026848616839,"member":5.481471909645883,"awar":5.481333126771467,"agent":5.4812339843533024,"integr":5.481017639498762,"action":5.481017639498762,"knowlg":5.481017639498762,"commun":5.480870378035768,"structur":5.480870378035768,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"social":5.4808373163592075,"control":5.480812519384437,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"task":5.4807651779977995,"role":5.480761464853082,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"40ad8325-d0ef-3743-8b16-a822b77678fe","title":"CONRO: towards deployable robots with inter-robot metamorphic capabilities","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/conro-towards-deployable-robots-interrobot-metamorphic-capabilities/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/conro-towards-deployable-robots-interrobot-metamorphic-capabilities/","creator":"Andres Castano, Wei Min Shen, Peter Will","description":"Metamorphic robots are modular robots that can reconfigure their shape. Such capability is desirable in tasks such as earthquake search and rescue and battlefield surveillance and scouting, where robots must go through unexpected situations and obstacles and perform tasks that are difficult for fixed-shape robots. The capabilities of the robots are determined by the design specification of their modules. In this paper, we present the design specification of a CONRO module, a small, self-sufficient and relatively homogeneous module that can be connected to other modules to form complex robots. These robots have not only the capability of changing their shape (intra-robot metamorphing) but also can split into smaller robots or merge with other robots to create a single larger robot (inter-robot metamorphing), i.e., CONRO robots can alter their shape and their size. Thus, heterogeneous robot teams can be built with homogeneous components. Furthermore, the CONRO robots can separate the reconfiguration stage from the locomotion stage, allowing the selection of configuration-dependent gaits. The locomotion and automatic inter-module docking capabilities of such robots were tested using tethered prototypes that can be reconfigured manually. We conclude the paper discussing the future work needed to fully realize the construction of these robots.","collectionName":"Autonomous Robots","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2000"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":104.13343731338325,"capabl":27.40527751613604,"conro":21.930880358183263,"inter":16.445040143551203,"shape":16.443999380314402,"reconfigur":10.965440179091631,"metamorphing":10.965440179091631,"locomot":10.962943819291766,"stage":10.962666253542935,"specif":10.962467968706605,"task":10.961530355995599,"surveil":5.482720089545816,"fix":5.482720089545816,"shap":5.482720089545816,"battlefield":5.482720089545816,"configuration":5.482720089545816,"intra":5.482720089545816,"earthquak":5.482720089545816,"split":5.482720089545816,"gait":5.482026848616839,"construct":5.481680047850402,"rescu":5.481680047850402,"depend":5.481333126771467,"prototyp":5.481333126771467,"compon":5.481055503227208,"obstacl":5.481055503227208,"team":5.480936498109847,"work":5.480729498950042,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"6c7f91b6-cd77-3aae-88e9-3ebf20b1814b","title":"A two-tiered global path planning strategy for limited memory mobile robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/twotiered-global-path-planning-strategy-limited-memory-mobile-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/twotiered-global-path-planning-strategy-limited-memory-mobile-robots/","creator":"Praneel Chand, Dale A.

For multi-robot tasks such as exploration of large environments, some of the available robots may only possess simple embedded controllers with limited memory capacity. However, in some situations these limited robots may be required to perform global path planning to navigate beyond localised regions of the large environment. Global path planning can be problematic for the limited memory robots if they are unable to store the entire map in their local memory. Hence, this paper presents and evaluates a two-tiered path planning technique to permit global path planning. A set of local maps describing the global map is searched using a two-tiered A* algorithm that executes entirely on the limited memory robots. Planning time, data communication and path length are evaluated for various combinations of local and global maps. Employing smaller local map sizes in large global maps is capable of yielding superior or comparable execution times to non-memory constrained planning. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Nelson, Gregory J. Barlow, Lefteris Doitsidis","description":"This paper surveys fitness functions used in the field of evolutionary robotics (ER). Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process-one might argue, the key component-is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It discusses all facets of mobile robotics, including hardware design, wheel design, kinematics analysis, sensors and perception, localization, mapping, and robot control architectures.The design of any successful robot involves the integration of many different disciplines, among them kinematics, signal analysis, information theory, artificial intelligence, and probability theory. Reflecting this, the book presents the techniques and technology that enable mobility in a series of interacting modules. Each chapter covers a different aspect of mobility, as the book moves from low-level to high-level details. The first two chapters explore low-level locomotory ability, examining robots' wheels and legs and the principles of kinematics. This is followed by an in-depth view of perception, including descriptions of many \"off-the-shelf\" sensors and an analysis of the interpretation of sensed data. The final two chapters consider the higher-level challenges of localization and cognition, discussing successful localization strategies, autonomous mapping, and navigation competence. Bringing together all aspects of mobile robotics into one volume, Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots can serve as a textbook for coursework or a working tool for beginners in the field.","collectionName":"Robotica","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2004"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":60.287779497221884,"mobil":54.808839913495895,"local":21.92533250708587,"autonom":21.9233889399078,"kinemat":16.446080545850517,"wheel":10.965440179091631,"percept":10.962111006454416,"move":10.962035278997524,"sensor":10.961872996219695,"technologi":10.961476249541146,"bring":5.482720089545816,"locomotori":5.482720089545816,"beginn":5.482720089545816,"sojourn":5.482720089545816,"mar":5.482720089545816,"pathfind":5.482720089545816,"coursework":5.482720089545816,"pari":5.482720089545816,"metro":5.482720089545816,"seri":5.482026848616839,"interpret":5.482026848616839,"reader":5.482026848616839,"facet":5.482026848616839,"textbook":5.482026848616839,"probabl":5.482026848616839,"compet":5.482026848616839,"disciplin":5.482026848616839,"signal":5.481680047850402,"volum":5.481680047850402,"descript":5.481471909645883,"leg":5.481471909645883,"intellig":5.481471909645883,"mission":5.481471909645883,"cognition":5.481471909645883,"locomot":5.481471909645883,"architectur":5.4812339843533024,"hardwar":5.4812339843533024,"student":5.481101779170666,"integr":5.481017639498762,"motion":5.480986085296529,"navig":5.480916662546665,"tool":5.480916662546665,"abil":5.48084723497695,"control":5.480812519384437,"world":5.480727571894862,"real":5.480725725130163,"inform":5.480722253203296,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"27d8886d-a4be-3554-8a39-0c1451e5818f","title":"Adaptive navigation for autonomous robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/adaptive-navigation-autonomous-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/adaptive-navigation-autonomous-robots/","creator":"Matt Knudson, Kagan Tumer","description":"In many robotic exploration missions, robots have to learn specific policies that allow them to: (i) select high level goals (e.g., identify specific destinations), (ii) navigate (reach those destinations), (iii) and adapt to their environment (e.g., modify their behavior based on changing environmental conditions). Furthermore, those policies must be robust to signal noise or unexpected situations, scalable to more complex environments, and account for the physical limitations of the robots (e.g., limited battery power and computational power). In this paper we evaluate reactive and learning navigation algorithms for exploration robots that must avoid obstacles and reach specific destinations in limited time and with limited observations. Our results show that neuro-evolutionary algorithms with well-designed evaluation functions can produce up to 50% better performance than reactive algorithms in complex domains where the robot's goals are to select paths that lead to seek specific destinations while avoiding obstacles, particularly when facing significant sensor and actuator signal noise. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The idea is to produce robots that can help humans and cohabit their environments. For this purpose, the body plan, sensory and actuator system of the robot, as well as its cognitive abilities must be designed to perform real-world tasks including dynamic walking, interaction with people or object recognition and manipulation. Reem-B achieves this scope by using two legs, two strong arms with fingered hands, and a software suite that controls all its degrees of freedom, coordinating them with vision and auditory systems. The main difference with other humanoids of its size is its level of autonomy. Autonomy in this robot has been improved from other robots at three different levels: with an increased battery life (estimated twice of the competitors), with the ability to autonomously navigate in indoor environments while avoiding obstacles, and by integrating all the control systems within the robot itself.","collectionName":"2008 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots, Humanoids 2008","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2008"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":49.32636504318154,"reem":16.448160268637448,"humanoid":16.442397500737684,"system":16.442069205177553,"autonomi":10.962666253542935,"abil":10.9616944699539,"control":10.961625038768874,"human":10.961421519684295,"environ":10.961419084634679,"pal":5.482720089545816,"competitors":5.482720089545816,"cohabit":5.482720089545816,"auditori":5.482720089545816,"suit":5.482026848616839,"batteri":5.482026848616839,"freom":5.481471909645883,"leg":5.481471909645883,"scope":5.481471909645883,"idea":5.481333126771467,"actuat":5.4812339843533024,"arm":5.481159621088721,"softwar":5.481159621088721,"manipul":5.481101779170666,"bodi":5.481101779170666,"plan":5.481101779170666,"obstacl":5.481055503227208,"platform":5.481017639498762,"autonom":5.48084723497695,"vision":5.48084723497695,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"life":5.480828299348617,"recognit":5.480812519384437,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"task":5.4807651779977995,"object":5.4807175366040894}},{"id":"31426089-8a0a-34ee-a0d5-87c10bf76eab","title":"An architecture for cooperative and autonomous mobile robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/architecture-cooperative-autonomous-mobile-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/architecture-cooperative-autonomous-mobile-robots/","creator":"F.R.

We present the first robotic controller capable of functional self-assembly implemented on a real robotic platform. The task we consider requires a group of robots to navigate over an area of unknown terrain towards a target light source. If possible, the robots should navigate to the target independently. If, however, the terrain proves too difficult for a single robot, the robots should self-assemble into a larger group entity and collectively navigate to the target. We believe this to be one of the most complex tasks carried out to date by a team of physical autonomous robots. We present quantitative results confirming the efficacy of our controller.

Especially during the two recent DARPA grand challenges, autonomous cars have been shown to robustly navigate over extended periods of time through complex desert courses or through dynamic urban traffic environments. In these tasks, the robots typically relied on GPS traces to follow pre-defined trajectories so that only local planners were required. In this paper, we present an approach for autonomous navigation of cars in indoor structures such as parking garages. Our approach utilizes multi-level surface maps of the corresponding environments to calculate the path of the vehicle and to localize it based on laser data in the absence of sufficiently accurate GPS information. It furthermore utilizes a local path planner for controlling the vehicle. In a practical experiment carried out with an autonomous car in a real parking garage we demonstrate that our approach allows the car to autonomously park itself in a large-scale multi-level structure.","collectionName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"autonom":27.404236174884748,"car":21.92533250708587,"structur":16.442611134107306,"multi":16.44257459263578,"garag":10.965440179091631,"vehicl":10.963360095700803,"planner":10.962943819291766,"gp":10.962666253542935,"path":10.96183332509333,"navig":10.96183332509333,"environ":10.961419084634679,"robot":10.961414454040343,"traffic":5.482720089545816,"desert":5.482720089545816,"laser":5.482026848616839,"cour":5.482026848616839,"darpa":5.482026848616839,"automobil":5.482026848616839,"trajectori":5.481680047850402,"absenc":5.481680047850402,"trace":5.481680047850402,"surfac":5.4812339843533024,"park":5.4812339843533024,"map":5.481159621088721,"interest":5.481017639498762,"commun":5.480870378035768,"task":5.4807651779977995,"time":5.480757963875433,"experi":5.480748566453773,"real":5.480725725130163,"present":5.4807239537404095,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"4bf6ee17-bc2a-3c22-a1ba-63973406b22d","title":"Autonomous manipulation with a general-purpose simple hand","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/autonomous-manipulation-generalpurpose-simple-hand/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/autonomous-manipulation-generalpurpose-simple-hand/","creator":"M.

It raises arguments both for and against simple hands, it considers several familiar examples, and it proposes an approach for autonomous manipulation using a general-purpose but simple hand.We explore the approach in the context of a bin-picking task, focused on grasping, recognition, and localization. The central idea is to use learned knowledge of stable grasp poses as a cue for object recognition and localization. This leads to some novel design criteria, such as minimizing the number of stable grasp poses.

The computer model we have built aims to demonstrate how autonomous controllers for groups of flying robots can be successfully developed through simulations based on multi-agent systems and evolutionary robotics methodologies. We first introduce the field of autonomous flying robots, reviewing the most relevant contributes on this research field and highlighting the elements of novelty contained in our approach. We then describe the simulation model we have elaborated and the results obtained in different experimental scenarios. In all experiments, MAV teams made by four agents have to navigate autonomously through an unknown environment, reach a certain target and finally neutralize it through a self-detonation. The different setups comprise an environment with various obstacles (skyscrapers) and a fixed target, one with a moving target, and one where the target (fixed or moving) needs to be attacked cooperatively in order to be neutralized. The results obtained show how the evolved controllers are able to perform the various tasks with an accuracy level between 72% and 94% when the target has to be approached individually. The performance slightly decreases only when the target is both able to move and can only be neutralized through a coordinated operation.

This paper surveys earlier studies on multi-agent robots for each type, such as multi-robot motion-planning algorithms and exploration algorithms of multiple robots. The tasks that multi-agent robots can perform are becoming increasingly more complex as they move from single, one-time tasks to those involving many iterations.

An initial instruction is required even if they do their tasks autonomously. We therefore need interfaces for the operation and teaching of robots. Natural languages, joysticks, and other pointing devices are currently used for this purpose. These interfaces, however, have difficulty in operating multiple robots simultaneously. We developed a multi-touch interface with a top-down view from a ceiling camera for controlling multiple mobile robots. The user specifies a vector field followed by all robots on the view. This paper describes the user interface and its implementation, and future work of the project.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the 27th","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":38.3649505891412,"interfac":27.404682490549238,"touch":10.962467968706605,"mobil":10.961767982699179,"multi":10.96171639509052,"task":10.961530355995599,"user":10.961515927750867,"command":5.482720089545816,"joystick":5.482720089545816,"difficulti":5.482720089545816,"multipl":5.482026848616839,"vector":5.482026848616839,"instruct":5.481680047850402,"languag":5.481680047850402,"top":5.481680047850402,"down":5.481680047850402,"natur":5.481017639498762,"camera":5.480916662546665,"project":5.4808993061061235,"ceil":5.4808993061061235,"devic":5.4808993061061235,"oper":5.480870378035768,"order":5.480793232423387,"work":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"4060559a-9a90-33b6-9f19-5fc7f913cc62","title":"The Advisor Robot: Tracing People’s Mental Model from a Robot’s Physical Attributes","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/advisor-robot-tracing-peoples-mental-model-robots-physical-attributes/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/advisor-robot-tracing-peoples-mental-model-robots-physical-attributes/","creator":"Aaron Powers, Aaron Powers, Sara Kiesler, Sara Kiesler","description":" Humanoid robots offer many physical design choices such as voice frequency and head dimensions. We used hierarchical statistical mediation analysis to trace differences in people's mental model of robots from these choices. In an experiment, a humanoid robot gave participants online advice about their health. We used mediation analysis to identify the causal path from the robot's voice and head dimensions to the participants' mental model, and to their willingness to follow the robot's advice. The male robot voice predicted impressions of a knowledgeable robot, whose advice participants said they would follow. Increasing the voice's fundamental frequency reduced this effect. The robot's short chin length (but not its forehead dimensions) predicted impressions of a sociable robot, which also predicted intentions to take the robot's advice. We discuss the use of this approach for designing robots for different roles, when people's mental model of the robot matters.","collectionName":"HRI '06: Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGCHI/SIGART Conference on Human-Robot Interaction","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2006"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":76.7299011782824,"advic":21.930880358183263,"voic":21.928107394467357,"impress":10.965440179091631,"miation":10.965440179091631,"frequenc":10.963360095700803,"dimens":10.962943819291766,"choic":10.962467968706605,"head":10.962203558341333,"humanoid":10.961598333825123,"people":5.482720089545816,"chin":5.482720089545816,"advisor":5.482720089545816,"dimenss":5.482720089545816,"mental":5.482720089545816,"forehead":5.482720089545816,"attribut":5.482720089545816,"length":5.482026848616839,"but":5.482026848616839,"willing":5.482026848616839,"physical":5.482026848616839,"intent":5.481680047850402,"trace":5.481680047850402,"matter":5.481333126771467,"offer":5.481101779170666,"health":5.481017639498762,"path":5.480916662546665,"role":5.480761464853082,"experi":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"a556304a-b837-3788-8eff-6dd7f3b3742e","title":"Human-centered robot navigation - Toward a harmoniously coexisting multi-human and multi-robot environment","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/humancentered-robot-navigation-toward-harmoniously-coexisting-multihuman-multirobot-environment/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/humancentered-robot-navigation-toward-harmoniously-coexisting-multihuman-multirobot-environment/","creator":"Chi Pang Lam, Chen Tun Chou, Chih Fu Chang, Li Chen Fu","description":"This paper proposes a navigation algorithm that considers the states of humans and other robots in order to achieve harmonious coexistence between robots and humans.

Programming by \"touch\" is very intuitive as you take the robot by the hand and demonstrate the movements. This feature can also be used to interact with the service robot while executing a task.

The typical HRI-based peer role model is appropriate for the android, the future intelligent robot, but it failed to take into account the state of temporary robotics. In this study, a role model was proposed by allowing for the evolutionary aspects in step with the level of robot technology. Also, the feasibility of the proposed evolutionary role model was demonstrated through the experiments after parents and children interacted with a home robot that had various functions for family members. The results showed that the expected roles of home robots are user, secretary, and peer. Most of parents thought of them as human-like machines while children regarded them as peers. Home robot's facial expressions depend on their roles. So, we investigated the facial expression set of home robots at work and compared them with Ekman's. We also hypothesized that if the facial expression set for a home robot at work is different from the expected one, it had a significant impact on evaluation. The results suggested the necessity of new modelling of facial expressions for home robots based on the evolutionary role model.","collectionName":"ROMAN 2005.

We model these zones as various sensitive fields with priorities, whereby robots tend to yield socially acceptable movements.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"robot":65.76848672424205,"human":38.364975318895034,"navig":27.404583312733326,"zone":10.964053697233679,"hcsn":10.964053697233679,"rule":10.962943819291766,"environ":10.961419084634679,"navigat":5.482720089545816,"guarante":5.482026848616839,"coexist":5.482026848616839,"secur":5.481680047850402,"avoid":5.481680047850402,"prioriti":5.481680047850402,"toward":5.481471909645883,"obstacl":5.481055503227208,"space":5.481017639498762,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"attent":5.480936498109847,"movem":5.4808993061061235,"region":5.48084723497695,"algorithm":5.480828299348617,"order":5.480793232423387}},{"id":"20520596-3695-3c09-ae3b-cc191fcd919b","title":"A General-Purpose 7 DOF Haptic Device: Applications Toward Robot-Assisted Surgery","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/generalpurpose-7-dof-haptic-device-applications-toward-robotassisted-surgery/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/generalpurpose-7-dof-haptic-device-applications-toward-robotassisted-surgery/","creator":"G.

The device consists of four degrees of force feedback (X, Y, Z, and grasping) capability and seven degrees of position feedback capability. It has a closed kinematic chain with two halves (user interface and spatial mechanism) that connect together via a universal joint. The user interface contains four degrees of position feedback, namely, the roll, pitch, yaw, and linear motion of the hand and forearm. In addition, a grasping mechanism with two thimbles mounted at the end of the user interface provides force feedback to the fingers of the user. The spatial mechanism provides force feedback to the user interface through a universal joint located at the grasping mechanism. This paper presents the design and development of this haptic device. In addition, a kinematic and workspace analysis of the device has been completed to compute the position of the slave robot and end-effector tool. Friction estimation has been presented to enable a higher transparency of the haptic device. Finally, a simulation of needle insertion into soft tissue was developed to test the device.","collectionName":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"devic":38.366295142742864,"user":27.403789819377167,"haptic":21.926720191401607,"interfac":21.92374599243939,"forc":16.442878154427728,"surgeri":10.965440179091631,"kinemat":10.964053697233679,"dof":10.964053697233679,"capabl":10.962111006454416,"yaw":5.482720089545816,"halv":5.482720089545816,"tissu":5.482720089545816,"grasping":5.482720089545816,"mechanism":5.482720089545816,"roll":5.482720089545816,"pitch":5.482720089545816,"insert":5.482720089545816,"nele":5.482720089545816,"friction":5.482720089545816,"thimbl":5.482720089545816,"finger":5.482720089545816,"slave":5.482720089545816,"forearm":5.482026848616839,"transpar":5.482026848616839,"effector":5.482026848616839,"workspac":5.481680047850402,"chain":5.481101779170666,"motion":5.480986085296529,"simul":5.480936498109847,"tool":5.480916662546665,"develop":5.480740544194678,"robot":5.480707227020171}},{"id":"c22dec5e-ed01-3057-aac4-d1faa8487e77","title":"Learning to fall: Designing low damage fall sequences for humanoid soccer robots","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/learning-fall-designing-low-damage-fall-sequences-humanoid-soccer-robots/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/learning-fall-designing-low-damage-fall-sequences-humanoid-soccer-robots/","creator":"J.

It is a key feature for building robots capable of navigating and performing tasks in human environments. However, current object recognition research largely ignores the problems that the mobile robot context introduces. We developed a landmark recognition system which is used by a humanoid robot to identify landmarks during its navigation. The humanoid landmark recognition system is based on a two-step classification stage which is robust and invariant towards scaling and translations. Also, it provides a good balance between fast processing time and high detection accuracy. An appearance-based classification method is initially used to provide the rough initial estimate of the landmark. It is followed by a refinement step using a model-based method to estimate an accurate classification of the object. The goal of our work is to develop a rapid, robust object recognition system with a high detection rate that can actually be used by a humanoid robot to recognize landmarks during its navigation.","collectionName":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2008","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2008"},"index":4,"keywords":{"landmark":38.374187940317874,"recognit":32.884875116306624,"robot":32.884243362121026,"navig":21.92366665018666,"humanoid":21.923196667650245,"system":21.922758940236736,"classif":16.443305337512,"object":16.44215260981227,"detect":10.962666253542935,"refin":5.482026848616839,"translat":5.481680047850402,"stage":5.481333126771467,"balanc":5.481159621088721,"accuraci":5.481101779170666,"mobil":5.4808839913495895,"featur":5.4808839913495895,"context":5.480799166912561,"task":5.4807651779977995,"time":5.480757963875433,"work":5.480729498950042,"human":5.480710759842148,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"5d5b990a-c698-34ac-a3eb-6b92244197a7","title":"Vision-guided humanoid footstep planning for dynamic environments","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/visionguided-humanoid-footstep-planning-dynamic-environments/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/visionguided-humanoid-footstep-planning-dynamic-environments/","creator":"Philipp Michel, Joel Chestnutt, James Kuffner, Takeo Kanade","description":"Despite the stable walking capabilities of modern biped humanoid robots, their ability to autonomously and safely navigate obstacle-filled, unpredictable environments has so far been limited.

A number of methodologies and technologies required in order to achieve the long-term goal of cooperation of heterogeneous autonomous robots are discussed, including modeling tasks and robot abilities, task assignment and redistribution, robot behavior modeling and programming, robot middleware and robot simulation. Example solutions and their application to the cooperation of autonomous wheeled and humanoid robots are presented in this case study.

Infants in the other conditions, however, looked longer at the test event where the second experimenter talked to the robot rather than where the second experimenter talked to the person.

While a large number of sensing technologies exist, it is not trivial to incorporate them into a robot. We have developed a compliant &#x201C;skin&#x201D; for humanoids that integrates a distributed pressure sensor based on capacitive technology. The skin is modular and can be deployed on nonflat surfaces. Each module scans locally a limited number of tactile-sensing elements and sends the data through a serial bus. This is a critical advantage as it reduces the number of wires. The resulting system is compact and has been successfully integrated into three different humanoid robots. We have performed tests that show that the sensor has favorable characteristics and implemented algorithms to compensate the hysteresis and drift of the sensor. Experiments with the humanoid robot iCub prove that the sensors can be used to grasp unmodeled, fragile objects.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"sensor":27.404682490549238,"robot":27.403536135100858,"humanoid":21.923196667650245,"technologi":16.442214374311718,"skin":10.964053697233679,"nonflat":5.482720089545816,"drift":5.482720089545816,"hysteresi":5.482720089545816,"bu":5.482720089545816,"capacit":5.482720089545816,"wire":5.482720089545816,"icub":5.482720089545816,"scan":5.482720089545816,"pressur":5.481680047850402,"sens":5.481471909645883,"touch":5.4812339843533024,"surfac":5.4812339843533024,"elem":5.481017639498762,"algorithm":5.480828299348617,"experi":5.480748566453773,"object":5.4807175366040894,"human":5.480710759842148,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"edf23db6-dd8e-355a-8df1-7497567d5f67","title":"Push recovery by stepping for humanoid robots with force controlled joints","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/push-recovery-stepping-humanoid-robots-force-controlled-joints/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/push-recovery-stepping-humanoid-robots-force-controlled-joints/","creator":"Benjamin J.

It is postulated that the study of imitation learning offers a promising route to gain new insights into mechanisms of perceptual motor control that could ultimately lead to the creation of autonomous humanoid robots. Imitation learning focuses on three important issues: efficient motor learning, the connection between action and perception, and modular motor control in the form of movement primitives. It is reviewed here how research on representations of, and functional connections between, action and perception have contributed to our understanding of motor acts of other beings. The recent discovery that some areas in the primate brain are active during both movement perception and execution has provided a hypothetical neural basis of imitation. Computational approaches to imitation learning are also described, initially from the perspective of traditional Al and robotics, but also from the perspective of neural network models and statistical-learning research. Parallels and differences between biological and computational approaches to imitation are highlighted and an overview of current projects that actually employ imitation learning for humanoid robots is given.","collectionName":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1999"},"index":4,"keywords":{"imit":43.861760716366526,"robot":27.403536135100858,"motor":21.926720191401607,"humanoid":21.923196667650245,"percept":16.443166509681625,"rout":10.964053697233679,"connect":10.962943819291766,"perspect":10.962111006454416,"action":10.962035278997524,"movem":10.961798612212247,"control":10.961625038768874,"develop":10.961481088389355,"parallel":5.482720089545816,"primitif":5.482026848616839,"primat":5.482026848616839,"execut":5.481680047850402,"al":5.481680047850402,"creation":5.481680047850402,"brain":5.481680047850402,"discoveri":5.481680047850402,"be":5.481471909645883,"intellig":5.481471909645883,"act":5.481333126771467,"gain":5.481101779170666,"network":5.480936498109847,"project":5.4808993061061235,"autonom":5.48084723497695,"comput":5.480787721794762}},{"id":"914d84c8-8fd8-39e9-9d25-7e7332325979","title":"Footstep planning for the Honda ASIMO humanoid","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/footstep-planning-honda-asimo-humanoid/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/footstep-planning-honda-asimo-humanoid/","creator":"Joel Chestnutt, Manfred Lau, German Cheung, James Kuffner, Jessica Hodgins, Takeo Kanade","description":"  Despite the recent achievements in stable dynamic walking for many humanoid robots, relatively little navigation autonomy has been achieved.

The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon.

MOSAIC was originally proposed by neuroscientists to understand the human ability of adaptive control. The modular architecture of the MOSAIC model can be useful for solving nonlinear and non-stationary control problems. Both humans and humanoid robots have nonlinear body dynamics and many degrees of freedom. Since they can interact with environments (e.g., carrying objects), control strategies need to deal with non-stationary dynamics. Therefore, MOSAIC has strong potential as a human motor-control model and a control framework for humanoid robots. Yet application of the MOSAIC model has been limited to simple simulated dynamics since it is susceptive to observation noise and also cannot be applied to partially observable systems. Our approach introduces state estimators into MOSAIC architecture to cope with real environments. By using an extended MOSAIC model, we are able to successfully generate squatting and object-carrying behaviors on a real humanoid robot. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Neural Networks","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2012"},"index":4,"keywords":{"mosaic":38.37904062682071,"control":32.884875116306624,"humanoid":27.403995834562807,"robot":27.403536135100858,"dynamic":16.443999380314402,"architectur":16.443701953059907,"real":16.442177175390487,"human":16.442132279526444,"statari":10.965440179091631,"nonlinear":10.963360095700803,"non":10.961872996219695,"environ":10.961419084634679,"neuroscientist":5.482720089545816,"suscept":5.482720089545816,"emosa":5.482720089545816,"objects":5.482026848616839,"adapt":5.481680047850402,"freom":5.481471909645883,"nois":5.481333126771467,"extens":5.481333126771467,"bodi":5.481101779170666,"observ":5.481055503227208,"behavior":5.480959384809243,"abil":5.48084723497695,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"afc7d880-3516-334a-beca-8d573d206f25","title":"The development of Honda humanoid robot","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/development-honda-humanoid-robot/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/development-honda-humanoid-robot/","creator":"K.

A common application is to overlay screen-aligned annotations for real world objects to create in-situ information displays for users. While the referenced object&amp;rsquo;s location is fixed in the view the annotating labels should be placed in such a way as to not interfere with other content of interest such as other labels or objects in the real world. We present a new approach to determine and track areas with less visual interest based on feature density and to automatically compute label layout from this information. The algorithm works in under 5ms per frame, which is fast enough that it can be used with existing AR systems. Moreover, it provides flexible constraints for controlling label placement behaviour to the application designer. The resulting overlays are demonstrated with a simple hand-held augmented reality system for information display in a lab environment.","collectionName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"label":21.926720191401607,"inform":21.922889012813183,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"world":16.442182715684588,"real":16.442177175390487,"object":16.44215260981227,"annot":10.962467968706605,"interest":10.962035278997524,"ar":10.96171639509052,"displai":10.961674632718415,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"user":10.961515927750867,"present":10.961447907480819,"system":10.961379470118368,"lab":5.482720089545816,"situ":5.482720089545816,"densiti":5.482026848616839,"placem":5.481680047850402,"content":5.481680047850402,"layout":5.481471909645883,"rsquo":5.481471909645883,"track":5.481471909645883,"overlai":5.481333126771467,"behaviour":5.481333126771467,"frame":5.4812339843533024,"constraint":5.4812339843533024,"in":5.481159621088721,"interfac":5.480936498109847,"featur":5.4808839913495895,"locat":5.4808839913495895,"algorithm":5.480828299348617,"video":5.4808200663548945,"context":5.480799166912561,"work":5.480729498950042,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"b1477783-aeed-3101-84bc-2b98024e1929","title":"An augmented virtuality approach to 3D videoconferencing","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/augmented-virtuality-approach-3d-videoconferencing/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/augmented-virtuality-approach-3d-videoconferencing/","creator":"H.

This poses two major problems: (a) determining the precise alignment of real and virtual coordinate frames for overlay, and (b) capturing the 3D environment including camera and object motions. The latter is important for interactive augmented reality applications where users can interact with both real and virtual objects. Here we address the problem of accurately tracking the 3D motion of a monocular camera in a known 3D environment and dynamically estimating the 3D camera location. We utilize fully automated landmark-based camera calibration to initialize the motion estimation and employ extended Kalman filter techniques to track landmarks and to estimate the camera location. The implementation of our approach has been proven to be efficient and robust and our system successfully tracks in real-time at approximately 10 Hz.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the ACM symposium on Virtual reality software and technology - VRST '97","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1997"},"index":4,"keywords":{"camera":32.88549997527999,"motion":16.442958255889586,"virtual":16.44237969727016,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"real":16.442177175390487,"locat":10.961767982699179,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"object":10.961435073208179,"environ":10.961419084634679,"kalman":5.482720089545816,"hz":5.482720089545816,"objects":5.482026848616839,"align":5.482026848616839,"monocular":5.482026848616839,"filter":5.482026848616839,"landmark":5.482026848616839,"calibr":5.481680047850402,"track":5.481471909645883,"latter":5.481471909645883,"overlai":5.481333126771467,"frame":5.4812339843533024,"of":5.4812339843533024,"graphic":5.481159621088721,"initi":5.481101779170666,"video":5.4808200663548945,"imag":5.4808200663548945,"comput":5.480787721794762,"user":5.480757963875433,"world":5.480727571894862,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"00edb47c-a449-32f9-8f99-5c3ab275ec96","title":"A stereoscopic video see-through augmented reality system based on real-time vision-based registration","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/stereoscopic-video-seethrough-augmented-reality-system-based-onrealtime-visionbased-registration/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/stereoscopic-video-seethrough-augmented-reality-system-based-onrealtime-visionbased-registration/","creator":"M.

All the procedures must be done in real time. This paper proposes a method for augmented reality with a stereo vision sensor and a video see-through head-mounted display (HMD). It can synchronize the display timing between the virtual and real worlds so that the alignment error is reduced. The method calculates camera parameters from three markers in image sequences captured by a pair of stereo cameras mounted on the HMD. In addition, it estimates the real-world depth from a pair of stereo images in order to generate a composed image maintaining consistent occlusions between real and virtual objects. The depth estimation region is efficiently limited by calculating the position of the virtual object by using the camera parameters. Finally, we have developed a video see-through augmented reality system which mainly consists of a pair of stereo cameras mounted on the HMD and a standard graphics workstation.

Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between the terms \"real\" and \"virtual\" is shown to have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge (\"how much do we know about the world being displayed?\"), Reproduction Fidelity (\"how 'realistically' are we able to display it?\"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (\"what is the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that world?\"). key words: virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR)","collectionName":"IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1994"},"index":4,"keywords":{"virtual":54.80793232423387,"real":43.8458058010413,"displai":38.36586121451445,"realiti":38.36518380936275,"world":38.365093003264036,"mr":16.446080545850517,"taxonomi":16.44441572893765,"class":16.443052918496285,"extent":16.442958255889586,"environ":16.44212862695202,"vr":10.964053697233679,"continuum":10.963360095700803,"graphic":10.962319242177442,"ar":10.96171639509052,"comput":10.961575443589524,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"object":10.961435073208179,"mium":5.482720089545816,"viewer":5.482720089545816,"distinct":5.482720089545816,"illusion":5.482720089545816,"approximately":5.482720089545816,"fidel":5.482026848616839,"convers":5.481680047850402,"reproduct":5.481680047850402,"metaphor":5.481471909645883,"word":5.481471909645883,"av":5.481471909645883,"subset":5.481471909645883,"dimens":5.481471909645883,"map":5.481159621088721,"classif":5.481101779170666,"observ":5.481055503227208,"knowlg":5.481017639498762,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"imag":5.4808200663548945,"video":5.4808200663548945,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"6e1e4ab3-8034-395f-832f-6a3b1ce0a3ed","title":"Marker tracking and HMD calibration for a video-based augmented reality conferencing system","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/marker-tracking-hmd-calibration-videobased-augmentedreality-conferencing-system/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/marker-tracking-hmd-calibration-videobased-augmentedreality-conferencing-system/","creator":"H.

Augmented reality systems overlay computer-generated graphical information over the view of the real world. Several main research challenges can be identified in the field of augmented reality. These are the design of advanced display devices (e.g., head-mounted displays), camera tracking, system design, user interaction, and rendering. While a major part of the previous work focused on the problems of system design, camera tracking, and applications of AR, this thesis puts a different emphasis on the relatively underrepresented aspect of rendering techniques. In this thesis, several novel methods for displaying augmented video streams are explored. In the first part of this thesis in Chapter 2, the design and implementation of a novel system for medical augmented reality are discussed. The ARGUS framework is a new augmented reality system based on a commercial surgical navigation device. Since it does not require any additional hardware components, a transition into the clinical practice can be facilitated. Several extensions of the basic framework are described, including a hybrid tracking scheme, a user interaction library, and amethod for handling occlusion. The latter algorithm makes it possible to correctly render the occlusion of graphical objects by the anatomy of the patient, leading to a more realistic and easily comprehensible output. This approach is one of the advanced rendering methods for augmented reality investigated in the context of this thesis. The second part of this thesis, Chapter 3, introduces the concept of stylized augmented reality, which applies artistic or illustrative stylization methods to augmented reality video streams. Since the same type of stylization is applied to virtual and real scene elements, they become difficult to distinguish. This way, a novel augmented reality experience is created, and possibly even a better immersion. Real-time algorithms for cartoon-like and painterly brush stroke stylization of augmented video streams are described. The exploitation of programmable graphics hardware for this purpose is discussed. Moreover, the results of a psychophysical study on the discernability of virtual objects in stylized augmented reality are presented. At the beginning of Chapter 4, which is the third part of this thesis, a novel illustrative visualization method is described. This new rendering algorithm for iso-surfaces and polygonal models generates an illustrative representation of a surface and structures hidden behind it. The method is designed for the programmable rendering pipelines of modern graphics hardware and is capable of displaying complex models in real-time. An extension of this newly developed illustrative display style was also applied to augmented reality video streams.

Essential factors which distinguish different MR display systems from each other are presented, first by means of a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and then by means of a three dimensional taxonomic framework comprising: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor. A principal objective of the taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a framework for classifying research across different disciplines.","collectionName":"Telemanipulator and Telepresence Technologies","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1995"},"index":4,"keywords":{"displai":32.88502389815525,"mr":16.446080545850517,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"object":16.44215260981227,"virtu":10.964053697233679,"reality":10.964053697233679,"continuum":10.963360095700803,"class":10.962035278997524,"extent":10.961972170593057,"virtual":10.961586464846773,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"taxonom":5.482720089545816,"terminologi":5.482720089545816,"rv":5.482720089545816,"disciplin":5.482026848616839,"fidel":5.482026848616839,"reproduct":5.481680047850402,"sens":5.481471909645883,"metaphor":5.481471909645883,"refer":5.481471909645883,"taxonomi":5.481471909645883,"av":5.481471909645883,"tabl":5.4812339843533024,"observ":5.481055503227208,"natur":5.481017639498762,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"knowlg":5.481017639498762,"ar":5.48085819754526,"scene":5.4808200663548945,"context":5.480799166912561,"world":5.480727571894862,"real":5.480725725130163,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"571961d8-e0e0-3267-95a0-7784dfe55f76","title":"A survey of augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-augmented-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/survey-augmented-reality/","creator":"Ronald Azuma, Ronald Azuma","description":"This paper surveys the field of Augmented Reality, in which 3-D virtual objects are integrated into a 3-D real environment in real time.

These models are a photogrammetric product per se. They are usually integrated into virtual reality scenarios where additional data such as sound, text or video can be introduced, leading to multimedia virtual environments. These environments allow users both to navigate and interact on different platforms such as desktop PCs, laptops and small hand-held devices (mobile phones or PDAs). In very recent years, a new technology derived from virtual reality has emerged: Augmented Reality (AR), which is based on mixing real and virtual environments to boost human interactions and real-life navigations. The synergy of AR and photogrammetry opens up new possibilities in the field of 3D data visualization, navigation and interaction far beyond the traditional static navigation and interaction in front of a computer screen. In this paper we introduce a low-cost outdoor mobile AR application to integrate buildings of different urban spaces. High-accuracy 3D photo-models derived from close-range photogrammetry are integrated in real (physical) urban worlds. The augmented environment that is presented herein requires for visualization a see-through video head mounted display (HMD), whereas user's movement navigation is achieved in the real world with the help of an inertial navigation sensor. After introducing the basics of AR technology, the paper will deal with real-time orientation and tracking in combined physical and virtual city environments, merging close-range photogrammetry and AR. There are, however, some software and complex issues, which are discussed in the paper. &amp;copy; 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Except a pair of video cameras, without any other sensors or artificial markers, users can use real rackets to hit virtual ping-pong ball on a virtual table and interact with remote partners in augmented reality scene just as they were playing ping-pong in the same place. First, the real racket can be detected and tracked in real-time in the video captured by a single camera in each site. By 3D registration, the real racket can seamlessly interact with the virtual ping-pong ball and table. Then, a communication scheme is designed for the consistent perception between users in collaborative augmented reality ping-pong system. To achieve real-time interaction, the whole method is implemented in a parallel computing environment through multi-core processors. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can provide consistent perception and natural user interaction with low latency and high precision.","collectionName":"Proceedings - 2011 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization, ICVRV 2011","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"ping":32.896320537274896,"pong":32.896320537274896,"racket":27.413600447729078,"real":27.403628625650814,"augmented":21.92313036472877,"realiti":21.92296217677871,"virtual":16.44237969727016,"user":16.4422738916263,"system":16.442069205177553,"ball":10.964053697233679,"tabl":10.962467968706605,"marker":10.962319242177442,"percept":10.962111006454416,"camera":10.96183332509333,"video":10.961640132709789,"interact":10.961538246397911,"processor":5.482720089545816,"cor":5.482720089545816,"precision":5.482720089545816,"latenc":5.482026848616839,"markerless":5.482026848616839,"partner":5.481680047850402,"site":5.481680047850402,"collabor":5.481471909645883,"pair":5.481471909645883,"scheme":5.481333126771467,"registr":5.4812339843533024,"place":5.481101779170666,"sensor":5.480936498109847,"commun":5.480870378035768,"multi":5.48085819754526,"scene":5.4808200663548945,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"b38d8fa2-7dc9-3575-af22-5284694d84d7","title":"Real-time markerless tracking for augmented reality: The virtual visual servoing framework","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/realtime-markerless-tracking-augmented-reality-virtual-visual-servoing-framework/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/realtime-markerless-tracking-augmented-reality-virtual-visual-servoing-framework/","creator":"Andrew I. Comport, Eric Marchand, Muriel Pressigout, Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Chaumette","description":"Tracking is a very important research subject in a real-time augmented reality context. The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a \"video see through\" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. Here, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","collectionName":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2006"},"index":4,"keywords":{"object":21.922870146416358,"augmented":16.44234777354658,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"tracker":10.965440179091631,"pose":10.965440179091631,"scene":10.961640132709789,"context":10.961598333825123,"order":10.961586464846773,"virtual":10.961586464846773,"sphere":5.482720089545816,"cylinder":5.482720089545816,"circl":5.482720089545816,"fre":5.482720089545816,"contour":5.482720089545816,"deriv":5.482720089545816,"matrix":5.482720089545816,"curv":5.482720089545816,"squar":5.482026848616839,"illumin":5.482026848616839,"ge":5.482026848616839,"robust":5.482026848616839,"primitif":5.482026848616839,"monocular":5.482026848616839,"markerless":5.482026848616839,"latenc":5.482026848616839,"nonlinear":5.481680047850402,"law":5.481471909645883,"occlusion":5.4812339843533024,"line":5.4812339843533024,"sequenc":5.4812339843533024,"requir":5.4812339843533024,"accuraci":5.481101779170666,"subject":5.481101779170666,"to":5.480986085296529,"camera":5.480916662546665,"vision":5.48084723497695,"cost":5.480828299348617,"algorithm":5.480828299348617,"video":5.4808200663548945,"imag":5.4808200663548945,"control":5.480812519384437,"chang":5.480793232423387,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"environ":5.4807095423173395,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"432c7359-3645-3296-b0cb-a7eade1daf8f","title":"Explorations in the Use of Augmented Reality for Geographic Visualization","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/explorations-augmented-reality-geographic-visualization/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/explorations-augmented-reality-geographic-visualization/","creator":"Nicholas R.

Our first interface combines three technologies: augmented reality (AR), immersive virtual reality (VR), and computer vision-based hand and object tracking. Wearing a lightweight display with an attached camera, users can look at a real map and see three-dimensional virtual terrain models overlaid on the map. From this AR interface, they can fly in and experience the model immersively, or use free hand gestures or physical markers to change the data representation. Building on this work, our second interface explores alternative interface techniques, including a zoomable user interface, paddle interactions, and pen annotations. We describe the system hardware and software and the implications for GIS and spatial science applications.","collectionName":"Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2002"},"index":4,"keywords":{"interfac":32.88561898865908,"user":16.4422738916263,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"map":10.962319242177442,"visual":10.962111006454416,"ar":10.96171639509052,"virtual":10.961586464846773,"gi":5.482720089545816,"zoomabl":5.482720089545816,"paddl":5.482720089545816,"pen":5.482720089545816,"immers":5.482026848616839,"vr":5.482026848616839,"geograph":5.482026848616839,"gestur":5.481680047850402,"terrain":5.481471909645883,"annot":5.4812339843533024,"hardwar":5.4812339843533024,"softwar":5.481159621088721,"marker":5.481159621088721,"scienc":5.481017639498762,"camera":5.480916662546665,"displai":5.4808373163592075,"chang":5.480793232423387,"comput":5.480787721794762,"augmented":5.480782591182193,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"experi":5.480748566453773,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"work":5.480729498950042,"real":5.480725725130163,"object":5.4807175366040894,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"c6bd683b-cf1f-398e-80c4-43f53629a049","title":"Simulated augmented reality windshield display as a cognitive mapping aid for elder driver navigation","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/simulated-augmented-reality-windshield-display-cognitive-mapping-aid-elder-driver-navigation/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/simulated-augmented-reality-windshield-display-cognitive-mapping-aid-elder-driver-navigation/","creator":"SeungJun Kim, SeungJun Kim, Anind K.

To address this driving issue, we propose a novel concept of an in-vehicle navigation display system that displays navigation information directly onto the vehicle's windshield, superimposing it on the driver's view of the actual road. An evaluation of our simulated version of this display shows that it results in a significant reduction in navigation errors and distraction-related measures compared to a typical in-car navigation display for elder drivers. These results help us understand how context-sensitive information and a simulated augmented reality representation can be combined to minimize the cognitive load in translating between virtual/information spaces and the real world.","collectionName":"CHI","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"navig":27.404583312733326,"displai":27.404186581796036,"driver":21.925887638583532,"inform":16.442166759609886,"windshield":10.965440179091631,"vehicl":10.963360095700803,"in":10.962319242177442,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"realiti":10.961481088389355,"elder":5.482720089545816,"sensit":5.482720089545816,"road":5.482026848616839,"load":5.482026848616839,"declin":5.481680047850402,"aid":5.481471909645883,"cognition":5.481471909645883,"version":5.481333126771467,"car":5.481333126771467,"error":5.4812339843533024,"ruction":5.481055503227208,"space":5.481017639498762,"context":5.480799166912561,"virtual":5.480793232423387,"world":5.480727571894862,"real":5.480725725130163,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"37ae15a1-985d-3501-ab36-0e5edf23153b","title":"Interactive mediated reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/interactive-mediated-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/interactive-mediated-reality/","creator":"R.

A number of techniques and technologies are now in use. These include EDM, GPS, and photogrammetric application, remote sensing and traditional building surveying applications. However, use of these technologies cannot be practical and efficient in regard to time, cost and accuracy. Furthermore, a multi disciplinary knowledge base, created from the studies and research about the regeneration aspects is fundamental: historical, architectural, archeologically, environmental, social, economic, etc. In order to have an adequate diagnosis of regeneration, it is necessary to describe buildings and surroundings by means of documentation and plans. However, at this point in time the foregoing is considerably far removed from the real situation, since more often than not it is extremely difficult to obtain full documentation and cartography, of an acceptable quality, since the material, constructive pathologies and systems are often insufficient or deficient (flat that simply reflects levels, isolated photographs,..). Sometimes the information in reality exists, but this fact is not known, or it is not easily accessible, leading to the unnecessary duplication of efforts and resources. In this paper, we discussed 3D laser scanning technology, which can acquire high density point data in an accurate, fast way. Besides, the scanner can digitize all the 3D information concerned with a real world object such as buildings, trees and terrain down to millimetre detail Therefore, it can provide benefits for refurbishment process in regeneration in the Built Environment and it can be the potential solution to overcome the challenges above. The paper introduce an approach for scanning buildings, processing the point cloud raw data, and a modelling approach for CAD extraction and building objects classification by a pattern matching approach in IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) format. The approach presented in this paper from an undertaken research can lead to parametric design and Building Information Modelling (BIM) for existing structures. Two case studies are introduced to demonstrate the use of laser scanner technology in the Built Environment. These case studies are the Jactin House Building in East Manchester and the Peel building in the campus of University Salford. Through these case studies, while use of laser scanners are explained, the integration of it with various technologies and systems are also explored for professionals in Built Environment","collectionName":"Automation in Construction","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"technologi":27.403690623852867,"environ":27.403547711586697,"scanner":21.930880358183263,"laser":21.928107394467357,"inform":21.922889012813183,"regener":16.446080545850517,"build":16.446080545850517,"document":10.965440179091631,"time":10.961515927750867,"world":10.961455143789724,"real":10.961451450260325,"object":10.961435073208179,"system":10.961379470118368,"peel":5.482720089545816,"manchest":5.482720089545816,"refurbish":5.482720089545816,"edm":5.482720089545816,"digit":5.482720089545816,"ifc":5.482720089545816,"jactin":5.482720089545816,"duplic":5.482720089545816,"cad":5.482720089545816,"millimetr":5.482720089545816,"photograph":5.482720089545816,"bim":5.482720089545816,"salford":5.482720089545816,"cartographi":5.482720089545816,"flat":5.482720089545816,"classes":5.482720089545816,"pathologi":5.482720089545816,"tree":5.482720089545816,"cloud":5.482720089545816,"east":5.482026848616839,"photogrammetr":5.482026848616839,"diagnosi":5.482026848616839,"hous":5.482026848616839,"base":5.482026848616839,"densiti":5.482026848616839,"surround":5.482026848616839,"campu":5.481680047850402,"regard":5.481680047850402,"includ":5.481680047850402,"format":5.481680047850402,"extract":5.481471909645883,"terrain":5.481471909645883,"foundat":5.481471909645883,"profession":5.481333126771467,"gp":5.481333126771467,"univers":5.481159621088721,"classif":5.481101779170666,"accuraci":5.481101779170666,"plan":5.481101779170666,"integr":5.481017639498762,"knowlg":5.481017639498762,"effort":5.480986085296529,"solution":5.480959384809243,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"structur":5.480870378035768,"multi":5.48085819754526,"social":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"materi":5.480799166912561,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"order":5.480793232423387,"environment":5.480751529614279,"realiti":5.480740544194678,"industri":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"3fe4a058-1f8b-32ec-8a74-a9cfc7ae18b4","title":"Missing data analysis: making it work in the real world.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/missing-data-analysis-making-it-work-real-world-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/missing-data-analysis-making-it-work-real-world-1/","creator":"John W Graham","description":"This review presents a practical summary of the missing data literature, including a sketch of missing data theory and descriptions of normal-model multiple imputation (MI) and maximum likelihood methods. Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably the inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing bias. Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.","collectionName":"Annual review of psychology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"attrition":21.930880358183263,"normal":10.965440179091631,"mi":10.965440179091631,"bia":10.962943819291766,"nonignor":5.482720089545816,"imput":5.482720089545816,"diagnost":5.482720089545816,"missing":5.482720089545816,"drop":5.482720089545816,"sketch":5.482720089545816,"follow":5.482720089545816,"likelihood":5.482026848616839,"uncertainti":5.482026848616839,"inclusion":5.482026848616839,"up":5.482026848616839,"summari":5.481680047850402,"intent":5.481680047850402,"suggest":5.481680047850402,"descript":5.481471909645883,"power":5.481017639498762,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"work":5.480729498950042,"world":5.480727571894862,"real":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"326b56ed-02e4-3510-a6c0-d3f0dcd8cae0","title":"Annotating real-world objects using augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/annotating-realworld-objects-using-augmented-reality-12/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/annotating-realworld-objects-using-augmented-reality-12/","creator":"Eric Rose, Eric Rose, David Breen, David Breen, Klaus H.

Since phones started integrating GPS, compass and accelerometer, several Augmented Reality browsers for phones have hit the market. These are applications that access large amounts of geo-referenced information from online sources and present it at corresponding physical locations, superimposed onto a live video stream. However, Augmented Reality is constrained by the camera's field of view and restricted to firstperson views, limiting the amount of overview that users can gain. We present two zooming interfaces that compensate for these constraints by enabling users to smoothly zoom between the Augmented Reality view and (1) an egocentric panoramic view of 360, and (2) an exocentric top-down view. We present the results from two studies that show how in most search tasks our zooming interfaces are faster and require less panning than an overlaybased tool, scaling better as the amount of information grows.","collectionName":"Information Systems Journal","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"realiti":27.40370272097339,"interfac":16.44280949432954,"present":16.44217186122123,"inform":16.442166759609886,"browser":10.965440179091631,"phone":10.964053697233679,"user":10.961515927750867,"firstperson":5.482720089545816,"exocentr":5.482720089545816,"acceleromet":5.482026848616839,"compass":5.482026848616839,"top":5.481680047850402,"down":5.481680047850402,"gp":5.481333126771467,"access":5.4812339843533024,"constraint":5.4812339843533024,"live":5.4812339843533024,"stream":5.4812339843533024,"gain":5.481101779170666,"visual":5.481055503227208,"tool":5.480916662546665,"camera":5.480916662546665,"locat":5.4808839913495895,"ar":5.48085819754526,"market":5.4808373163592075,"video":5.4808200663548945,"virtual":5.480793232423387,"task":5.4807651779977995,"world":5.480727571894862,"real":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"e2c993be-41fd-3a6e-8b72-fd3cd350b08f","title":"Pro Android augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/pro-android-augmented-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/pro-android-augmented-reality/","creator":"R Sood","description":"Augmented reality (AR)offers alive direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment, where the elements and surroundingsare augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as graphics and GPS data.

We focus our discussion on how the modeling of information is done for different levels (sensor and context data), present a multi-layered information model, its representation and the mapping between its layers.","collectionName":"2010 8th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops, PERCOM Workshops 2010","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"world":38.365093003264036,"sensor":32.88561898865908,"context":27.403995834562807,"internet":21.926720191401607,"inform":21.922889012813183,"rwi":16.448160268637448,"real":16.442177175390487,"architectur":10.962467968706605,"present":10.961447907480819,"layer":5.482720089545816,"sensei":5.482720089545816,"collect":5.481471909645883,"actuat":5.4812339843533024,"network":5.480936498109847,"role":5.480761464853082}},{"id":"1b285429-85d2-3b55-b738-4b2083dbde9a","title":"Augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/augmented-reality-144/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/augmented-reality-144/","creator":" Wikipedia contributors","description":"Augmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing one&amp;rsquo;s current perception of reality.[1] By contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.[2][3] Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable. Artificial information about the environment and its objects can be overlaid on the real world.","collectionName":"Wikipedia","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2013"},"index":4,"keywords":{"realiti":32.884443265168066,"world":16.442182715684588,"real":16.442177175390487,"elem":10.962035278997524,"ar":10.96171639509052,"comput":10.961575443589524,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"technologi":10.961476249541146,"inform":10.961444506406592,"object":10.961435073208179,"environ":10.961419084634679,"sport":5.482720089545816,"score":5.482720089545816,"tv":5.482720089545816,"help":5.482026848616839,"sound":5.482026848616839,"match":5.481680047850402,"augment":5.481680047850402,"rsquo":5.481471909645883,"one":5.481471909645883,"gp":5.481333126771467,"live":5.4812339843533024,"graphic":5.481159621088721,"contrast":5.481159621088721,"manipul":5.481101779170666,"percept":5.481055503227208,"input":5.480870378035768,"vision":5.48084723497695,"video":5.4808200663548945,"recognit":5.480812519384437,"context":5.480799166912561,"virtual":5.480793232423387,"user":5.480757963875433,"environment":5.480751529614279}},{"id":"d8b63226-3000-3e04-afdd-f2a31a3da6e9","title":"Puzzle assembly training: Real world vs virtual environment","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/puzzle-assembly-training-real-world-vs-virtual-environment/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/puzzle-assembly-training-real-world-vs-virtual-environment/","creator":"Mike Oren, Patrick Carlson, Stephen Gilbert, Judy M.

This paper represents the first study in an actual AR application of a specific view management task: evaluating the placement of 2D virtual labels that identify information about real counterparts. Here, we objectively evaluated four different placement algorithms, including a novel algorithm for placement based on identifying existing clusters. The evaluation included both a statistical analysis of traditional metrics (e.g. counting overlaps) and an empirical user study guided by principles from human cognition. The numerical analysis of the three real-time algorithms revealed that our new cluster-based method recorded the best average placement accuracy while requiring only relatively moderate computation time. Measures of objective readability from the user study demonstrated that in practice, human subjects were able to read labels fastest with the algorithms that most quickly prevented overlap, even if placement wasn't ideal.","collectionName":"The Second IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, 2003.

Most real DR approaches are highly computational expensive, not even allowing for interactive rates and/or apply significant restrictions regarding the uniformity of the background, or allow linear camera movements or even a static camera only. In this paper we will present a real-time capable Diminished Reality approach for high-quality image manipulation. Our approach achieves a significantly better performance and image quality for almost planar but non-trivial image backgrounds. Our Diminished Reality pipeline provides coherent video streams even for nonlinear camera movements due to the integration of homography based object tracking.","collectionName":"ISMAR 2012 - 11th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality 2012, Science and Technology Papers","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2012"},"index":4,"keywords":{"camera":21.92366665018666,"realiti":21.92296217677871,"dr":16.448160268637448,"background":16.44347886326616,"imag":16.442460199064683,"object":16.44215260981227,"stream":10.962467968706605,"frame":10.962467968706605,"movem":10.961798612212247,"video":10.961640132709789,"pseudo":5.482720089545816,"pixmix":5.482720089545816,"trivi":5.482720089545816,"homographi":5.482720089545816,"coher":5.482720089545816,"remov":5.482026848616839,"pipelin":5.482026848616839,"restrict":5.482026848616839,"uniform":5.481680047850402,"nonlinear":5.481680047850402,"manipul":5.481101779170666,"integr":5.481017639498762,"non":5.480936498109847,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"real":5.480725725130163,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"67971b5d-7b19-36b3-ac04-09d6b5039d1f","title":"Modified virtual reality for intuitive semantic information visualization","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/modified-virtual-reality-intuitive-semantic-information-visualization/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/modified-virtual-reality-intuitive-semantic-information-visualization/","creator":"Katja Einsfeld, Achim Ebert, J&amp;uuml;rgen W&amp;ouml;lle","description":"In order to make use of domain knowledge and thus to create less abstract visualizations of the available information, we propose to integrate information visualization techniques in 3D visualizations of the application subject.

We believe that this preliminary study gives a meaningful indication that employing the interactive field of view can be a useful method to decrease the physical load without any additional mental efforts in a mixed and augmented reality environment.","collectionName":"9th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality 2010: Science and Technology, ISMAR 2010 - Proceedings","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"user":21.923031855501733,"augmented":16.44234777354658,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"exmar":10.965440179091631,"load":10.964053697233679,"off":10.962943819291766,"screen":10.962666253542935,"decreas":10.962666253542935,"interest":10.962035278997524,"effort":10.961972170593057,"mobil":10.961767982699179,"increas":10.961740756071537,"invasion":5.482720089545816,"surround":5.482026848616839,"proof":5.482026848616839,"front":5.481680047850402,"examin":5.481680047850402,"usabl":5.481680047850402,"gestur":5.481680047850402,"relat":5.481159621088721,"contextu":5.481055503227208,"space":5.481017639498762,"movem":5.4808993061061235,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"environment":5.480751529614279,"inform":5.480722253203296,"object":5.4807175366040894,"environ":5.4807095423173395,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"1e011166-6f83-3c19-a57d-3cc5573e0d5c","title":"View management for virtual and augmented reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/view-management-virtual-augmented-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/view-management-virtual-augmented-reality/","creator":"Blaine Bell, Steven Feiner, Tobias H&amp;ouml;llerer","description":"We describe a view-management component for interactive 3D user interfaces. By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other, or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position, size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects may be annotations whose position and size are flexible.We introduce algorithms that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which objects can be placed to avoid occlusion. Layout decisions from previous frames are taken into account to reduce visual discontinuities. We present augmented reality and virtual reality examples to which we have applied our approach, including a dynamically labeled and annotated environment.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology - UIST '01","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2001"},"index":4,"keywords":{"object":43.845740292832716,"manag":21.923172929693546,"realiti":16.442221632584033,"plane":10.963360095700803,"properti":10.962666253542935,"constraint":10.962467968706605,"compon":10.962111006454416,"space":10.962035278997524,"project":10.961798612212247,"virtual":10.961586464846773,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"discontinu":5.482720089545816,"approxim":5.482720089545816,"transpar":5.482026848616839,"portion":5.482026848616839,"layout":5.481471909645883,"frame":5.4812339843533024,"annot":5.4812339843533024,"occlusion":5.4812339843533024,"decision":5.4812339843533024,"extent":5.480986085296529,"simul":5.480936498109847,"interfac":5.480936498109847,"algorithm":5.480828299348617,"user":5.480757963875433,"present":5.4807239537404095,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"eac86e25-8c02-363b-84bd-c4a9d4072cc2","title":"EyeTap Devices for Augmented, Deliberately Diminished, or Otherwise Altered Visual Perception of Rigid Planar Patches of Real-World Scenes","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/eyetap-devices-augmented-deliberately-diminished-otherwise-altered-visual-perception-rigid-planar-pa/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/eyetap-devices-augmented-deliberately-diminished-otherwise-altered-visual-perception-rigid-planar-pa/","creator":"Steve Mann, James Fung","description":"Diminished reality is as important as augmented reality, and both are possible with a device called the Reality Mediator. Over the past two decades, we have designed, built, worn, and tested many different embodiments of this device in the context of wearable computing. Incorporated into the Reality Mediator is an &ldquo;EyeTap&rdquo; system, which is a device that quantifies and resynthesizes light that would otherwise pass through one or both lenses of the eye(s) of a wearer. The functional principles of EyeTap devices are discussed, in detail. The EyeTap diverts into a spatial measurement system at least a portion of light that would otherwise pass through the center of projection of at least one lens of an eye of a wearer. The Reality Mediator has at least one mode of operation in which it reconstructs these rays of light, under the control of a wearable computer system. The computer system then uses new results in algebraic projective geometry and comparametric equations to perform head tracking, as well as to track motion of rigid planar patches present in the scene. We describe how our tracking algorithm allows an EyeTap to alter the light from a particular portion of the scene to give rise to a computer-controlled, selectively mediated reality. An important difference between mediated reality and augmented reality includes the ability to not just augment but also deliberately diminish or otherwise alter the visual perception of reality. For example, diminished reality allows additional information to be inserted without causing the user to experience information overload. Our tracking algorithm also takes into account the effects of automatic gain control, by performing motion estimation in both spatial as well as tonal motion coordinates.","collectionName":"Teleoperators and Virtual Environments","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2002"},"index":4,"keywords":{"realiti":54.80740544194678,"eyetap":27.413600447729078,"light":21.925887638583532,"devic":21.923597224424494,"system":21.922758940236736,"miator":16.448160268637448,"motion":16.442958255889586,"scene":16.442460199064683,"wearer":10.965440179091631,"patch":10.965440179091631,"wearabl":10.965440179091631,"portion":10.964053697233679,"len":10.963360095700803,"percept":10.962111006454416,"algorithm":10.961656598697234,"control":10.961625038768874,"comput":10.961575443589524,"augmented":10.961565182364385,"inform":10.961444506406592,"resynthes":5.482720089545816,"divert":5.482720089545816,"comparametr":5.482720089545816,"rai":5.482720089545816,"overload":5.482720089545816,"eye":5.482026848616839,"ey":5.482026848616839,"embodi":5.482026848616839,"quantifi":5.482026848616839,"center":5.482026848616839,"planar":5.482026848616839,"equat":5.481680047850402,"ldquo":5.481680047850402,"rdquo":5.481680047850402,"geometri":5.481471909645883,"track":5.481471909645883,"mode":5.481333126771467,"rise":5.481159621088721,"coordin":5.481159621088721,"head":5.481101779170666,"gain":5.481101779170666,"project":5.4808993061061235,"oper":5.480870378035768,"abil":5.48084723497695,"context":5.480799166912561,"user":5.480757963875433,"experi":5.480748566453773,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"e48aa505-f3b0-37c1-b02a-19860456ff83","title":"Multiview paraperspective projection model for diminished reality","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiview-paraperspective-projection-model-diminished-reality/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiview-paraperspective-projection-model-diminished-reality/","creator":"S.

Diminished reality can be considered an important part of many mixed and augmented reality applications. Our target application is the use of augmented reality (AR) to revamp procedures in industrial plants. An object or a region of interest is delineated on a single reference image. A paraperspective projection model is used to generate the correct background from multiple calibrated views of the scene. We propose methods to deal with approximately planar backgrounds with different orientations. We also propose a multi-resolution approach to deal with non-planar backgrounds. Different sets of experimental results demonstrate the success and limits of the algorithms. Results on real data from water treatment and power plants show the usefulness of this method for industrial applications.","collectionName":"The Second IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, 2003.

Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested.

Somehow, the brain uses limited variable examples to extract the essential characteristics of new visual categories. Here, I describe an approach to category learning and recognition that is based on recent computational advances. In this approach, objects are represented by a hierarchy of fragments that are extracted during learning from observed examples. The fragments are class-specific features and are selected to deliver a high amount of information for categorization. The same fragments hierarchy is then used for general categorization, individual object recognition and object-parts identification. Recognition is also combined with object segmentation, using stored fragments, to provide a top-down process that delineates object boundaries in complex cluttered scenes. The approach is computationally effective and provides a possible framework for categorization, recognition and segmentation in human vision. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To perform localization, one can take a sliding window approach, but this strongly increases the computational cost, because the classifier function has to be evaluated over a large set of candidate subwindows. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful branch-and-bound scheme that allows efficient maximization of a large class of classifier functions over all possible subimages. It converges to a globally optimal solution typically in sublinear time. We show how our method is applicable to different object detection and retrieval scenarios. The achieved speedup allows the use of classifiers for localization that formerly were considered too slow for this task, such as SVMs with a spatial pyramid kernel or nearest neighbor classifiers based on the chi&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;-distance.

Recognizing an object in an image is difficult when images include occlusion, poor quality, noise or background clutter, and this task becomes even more challenging when many objects are present in the same scene. Several models for object categorization use appearance and context information from objects to improve recognition accuracy. Appearance information, based on visual cues, can successfully identify object classes up to a certain extent. Context information, based on the interaction among objects in the scene or global scene statistics, can help successfully disambiguate appearance inputs in recognition tasks. In this work we address the problem of incorporating different types of contextual information for robust object categorization in computer vision. We review different ways of using contextual information in the field of object categorization, considering the most common levels of extraction of context and the different levels of contextual interactions. We also examine common machine learning models that integrate context information into object recognition frameworks and discuss scalability, optimizations and possible future approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.","collectionName":"Computer Vision and Image Understanding","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"object":65.76861043924907,"inform":32.88433351921977,"categor":27.406665633857337,"context":27.403995834562807,"appear":16.443701953059907,"contextu":16.443166509681625,"imag":16.442460199064683,"scene":16.442460199064683,"recognit":16.442437558153312,"interact":10.961538246397911,"task":10.961530355995599,"disambigu":5.482720089545816,"optim":5.481680047850402,"scalabl":5.481471909645883,"clutter":5.481471909645883,"extract":5.481471909645883,"inc":5.481471909645883,"nois":5.481333126771467,"cue":5.481333126771467,"occlusion":5.4812339843533024,"background":5.481159621088721,"accuraci":5.481101779170666,"machin":5.481017639498762,"class":5.481017639498762,"extent":5.480986085296529,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"categori":5.4808993061061235,"input":5.480870378035768,"vision":5.48084723497695,"comput":5.480787721794762,"work":5.480729498950042,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"e3dd0288-502d-3846-9e7e-cfe477f30d56","title":"The role of context in object recognition","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-context-object-recognition-16/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-context-object-recognition-16/","creator":"Aude Oliva, Antonio Torralba","description":"In the real world, objects never occur in isolation; they co-vary with other objects and particular environments, providing a rich source of contextual associations to be exploited by the visual system.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds","collectionName":"Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"1999"},"index":4,"keywords":{"imag":27.404100331774472,"object":27.403587683020447,"featur":21.923535965398358,"recognit":21.923250077537748,"kei":10.964053697233679,"gradient":5.482720089545816,"deform":5.482720089545816,"affin":5.482720089545816,"neuron":5.482720089545816,"cortex":5.482026848616839,"candid":5.482026848616839,"squar":5.482026848616839,"primat":5.482026848616839,"verif":5.482026848616839,"illumin":5.482026848616839,"plane":5.481680047850402,"invari":5.481680047850402,"match":5.481680047850402,"translat":5.481680047850402,"rotat":5.481680047850402,"paramet":5.481471909645883,"neighbor":5.481471909645883,"properti":5.481333126771467,"share":5.4812339843533024,"orient":5.4812339843533024,"class":5.481017639498762,"space":5.481017639498762,"solution":5.480959384809243,"project":5.4808993061061235,"input":5.480870378035768,"vision":5.48084723497695,"chang":5.480793232423387,"comput":5.480787721794762,"time":5.480757963875433,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"51166ea6-e3e1-3687-978e-1dfcaa4e5834","title":"Contextual priming for object detection","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/contextual-priming-object-detection/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/contextual-priming-object-detection/","creator":"Antonio Torralba","description":"There is general consensus that context can be a rich source of information about an object's identity, location and scale.

The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types.

Motivated by local distance learning, where a novel view of an object is compared to individual views of previously seen objects, we define a view-to-object distance where a novel view is compared simultaneously to all views of a previous object. This novel distance is based on a weighted combination of feature differences between views. We show, through jointly learning per-view weights, that this measure leads to superior classification performance on object category and instance recognition. More importantly, the proposed distance allows us to find a sparse solution via Group-Lasso regularization, where a small subset of representative views of an object is identified and used, with the rest discarded. This significantly reduces computational cost without compromising recognition accuracy. We evaluate the proposed technique, Instance Distance Learning (IDL), on the RGB-D Object Dataset, which consists of 300 object instances in 51 everyday categories and about 250,000 views of objects with both RGB color and depth. We empirically compare IDL to several alternative state-of-the-art approaches and also validate the use of visual and shape cues and their combination.","collectionName":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"object":60.287892902644984,"distanc":32.8888314578753,"rgb":21.926720191401607,"recognit":21.923250077537748,"depth":16.44441572893765,"categori":16.44269791831837,"idl":10.965440179091631,"combin":10.962319242177442,"rest":5.482720089545816,"lasso":5.482720089545816,"regular":5.482720089545816,"per":5.482720089545816,"repres":5.481680047850402,"weight":5.481680047850402,"subset":5.481471909645883,"shape":5.481333126771467,"color":5.481333126771467,"cue":5.481333126771467,"classif":5.481101779170666,"accuraci":5.481101779170666,"dataset":5.481055503227208,"to":5.480986085296529,"solution":5.480959384809243,"camera":5.480916662546665,"featur":5.4808839913495895,"cost":5.480828299348617,"context":5.480799166912561,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"work":5.480729498950042,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"7f2098ad-ad73-3429-9640-be3945f5cc87","title":"Multiclass object recognition with sparse, localized features","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiclass-object-recognition-sparse-localized-features/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/multiclass-object-recognition-sparse-localized-features/","creator":"Jim Mutch, David G.

We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The evolutionary process of a circular economy in China, from introduction of the concept and the relevant actions of national decision making to demonstration of the system nationwide, has taken only around 6 years, with strong encouragement from politicians and the urgent need to cope with environmental pollution and a severe shortage of natural resources. The circular economy in China is now being actively implemented at three levels: enterprises, eco-industrial parks, and regions. The consolidated theoretical bases of ecology and economics have helped the circular economy to define its position as a new economic model to effectively resolve the problems of resources and the environment. In this regard, material flow management is naturally a unique planning and management method for implementation of a circular economy, and eco-efficiency is a good indicator to measure circular economic activities. Of particular significance has been initiation of the legislative process for the Circular Economy Law, which is among a number of initiatives developing core policies for a circular economy in China. Stringent enforcement of a set of policies for energy saving and pollution abatement nowadays in China will certainly create an enabling environment for the development of a circular economy.","collectionName":"Journal of Material Cycles and Waste Management","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"circular":65.77060789619507,"economi":60.288725556657255,"china":38.36655548676893,"pollution":10.962666253542935,"initi":10.962203558341333,"eco":10.961918769618485,"polici":10.961674632718415,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"manag":10.961586464846773,"environ":10.961419084634679,"encourag":5.482720089545816,"ba":5.482720089545816,"enforc":5.482720089545816,"signific":5.482026848616839,"abat":5.482026848616839,"shortag":5.482026848616839,"politician":5.482026848616839,"demonstr":5.481680047850402,"regard":5.481680047850402,"law":5.481471909645883,"core":5.481471909645883,"enterpri":5.481333126771467,"answer":5.481333126771467,"park":5.4812339843533024,"decision":5.4812339843533024,"econom":5.481159621088721,"ecologi":5.481017639498762,"action":5.481017639498762,"effort":5.480986085296529,"flow":5.480936498109847,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"region":5.48084723497695,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"materi":5.480799166912561,"environment":5.480751529614279,"energi":5.480751529614279,"develop":5.480740544194678,"industri":5.480729498950042,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"a99aae2c-726e-3927-bf86-bd258f02bdbb","title":"Towards a Circular Economy - Economic and Business Rationale for an Accelerated Transition","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-economic-business-rationale-accelerated-transition/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-economic-business-rationale-accelerated-transition/","creator":" The Ellen MacArthur Foundation","description":"This report is the first ever to look at the economic and business rationale for an accelerated transition towards a circular economy.

Recent guidelines for LCA (International Reference Life Cycle Data System [ILCD] guidelines) are applied to answer the main research questions in the IS literature reviewed. A typology of five main research questions is proposed: (1) analysis, (2) improvement, and (3) expansion of existing systems; (4) design of new eco-industrial parks, and (5) restructuring of circular economies. The LCA guidelines were found useful in framing the question and choosing an appropriate reference case for comparison. The selection of a correct reference case reduces the risk of overestimating the benefits of by-product exchange. In the analysis of existing systems, environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) can be used to streamline the analysis and provide an industry average baseline for comparison. However, when large-scale changes are applied to the system, more sophisticated tools are necessary for assessment of the consequences, from market analysis to general equilibrium modeling and future scenario work. Such a rigorous application of systems analysis was not found in the current IS literature, but would benefit the field substantially, especially when the environmental impact of large-scale economic changes is analyzed.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"system":27.40344867529592,"industri":21.92291799580017,"refer":16.44441572893765,"lca":16.443305337512,"cycle":16.443166509681625,"assess":16.44280949432954,"life":16.44248489804585,"by":10.963360095700803,"comparison":10.962943819291766,"exchang":10.962319242177442,"chang":10.961586464846773,"environment":10.961503059228558,"product":10.961451450260325,"typologi":5.482720089545816,"eeioa":5.482720089545816,"equilibrium":5.482720089545816,"guidelines":5.482720089545816,"ilcd":5.482720089545816,"symbios":5.482026848616839,"expans":5.482026848616839,"risk":5.481680047850402,"is":5.481471909645883,"baselin":5.481471909645883,"answer":5.481333126771467,"statu":5.4812339843533024,"output":5.4812339843533024,"intern":5.4812339843533024,"park":5.4812339843533024,"improv":5.481159621088721,"consequ":5.481055503227208,"eco":5.480959384809243,"tool":5.480916662546665,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"circular":5.4808839913495895,"input":5.480870378035768,"symbiosi":5.48085819754526,"market":5.4808373163592075,"economi":5.480793232423387,"impact":5.480782591182193,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"develop":5.480740544194678,"work":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"18a48537-9888-3c58-a0cf-d9e33e700500","title":"Cradle to Cradle","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-1/","creator":"William McDonough, Michael Braungart","description":"Architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart argue that human industry need not damage the natural world.

In developed countries, 42% of food waste is produced by households, while 39% losses occur in the food manufacturing industry, 14% in food service sector and remaining 5% in retail and distribution. Increasingly, industrial ecology concepts such as cradle to cradle and circular economy are considered leading principle for eco-innovation, aiming at \"zero waste economy\" in which waste are used as raw material for new products and applications. The large amount of waste produced by the food industry, in addition to being a great loss of valuable materials, also raises serious management problems, both from the economic and environmental point of view. Many of these residues, however, have the potential to be reused into other production systems, trough e.g. biorefineries. The present work focuses on the use of food waste coming from food manufacturing (FWm). Through extensive literature review, the authors present feasibility and constraints of applying industrial symbiosis in recovering waste from food processing, focusing on recycling (excluding energy recovery) of the solid and liquid waste from food processing industry. The main uses of functional ingredients derived from this transformation are presented and discussed, highlighting mainstream sectors of application, e.g. in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Economic globalization requires systems approaches to promote sustainable economic development. The theory of material flow (MF) is one of the new theories that could positively contribute to the economic globalization. The theory of MF is also closely related to the concept of circular economy, as the pattern of material flow can be considered as a closed feedback process for circulatory purpose that is consisted of &amp;lsquo;resources-production-material flow-consumption-recycled resources&amp;rsquo;. It corresponds to the circular economy's development pattern of &amp;lsquo;resources-products-recycled resources&amp;rsquo;. In view of the pattern of material flow and its relevance to the circular economy, it is concluded that the theory of MF will contribute to the recirculation of natural resources, optimal utilization of resources, improving natural environment and especially the sustainable global economic development.

Although Germany and Japan have made important advances in building recycling incentives into their industrial systems and sought competitive advantage from doing so, China is arguably taking the issue even further (in principle) through its pursuit of a circular economy, now enshrined in law as an official national development goal. In this article, we review a number of the eco-industrial initiatives taken in China and compare them using a common graphical representation with comparable initiatives taken in the West and elsewhere in East Asia. Our aim is to demonstrate some common themes across the case studies, such as the transformation from the former linear economy to a circular economy and the evolutionary processes in which dynamic linkages are gradually established over time. We discuss the drivers of these eco-industrial initiatives as well as the inhibitors, setting the initiatives in an evolutionary framework and introducing a notion of Pareto eco-efficiency to evaluate them. We make the argument that China might be capturing latecomer advantages through its systematic promotion of eco-industrial initiatives within a circular economy framework.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"industri":38.3651064926503,"initi":32.886610675024,"eco":27.404796924046213,"economi":27.403966162116934,"china":21.92374599243939,"circular":21.923535965398358,"system":10.961379470118368,"inhibitor":5.482720089545816,"pareto":5.482720089545816,"principle":5.482720089545816,"incentif":5.482720089545816,"offici":5.482720089545816,"latecom":5.482720089545816,"pursuit":5.482720089545816,"west":5.482026848616839,"sustain":5.482026848616839,"east":5.482026848616839,"asia":5.482026848616839,"theme":5.482026848616839,"loop":5.481680047850402,"germani":5.481680047850402,"linkag":5.481471909645883,"law":5.481471909645883,"transform":5.481471909645883,"japan":5.481471909645883,"driver":5.481471909645883,"aim":5.481471909645883,"advanc":5.481159621088721,"in":5.481159621088721,"chain":5.481101779170666,"promotion":5.481055503227208,"progress":5.481017639498762,"interest":5.481017639498762,"solution":5.480959384809243,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"input":5.480870378035768,"wast":5.480782591182193,"time":5.480757963875433,"develop":5.480740544194678}},{"id":"e7c3ec7f-333e-3d5a-999f-d851a4cbdbae","title":"Remaking the industrial economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/remaking-industrial-economy/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/remaking-industrial-economy/","creator":"Hanh Nguyen, Martin Stuchtey, Markus Zils","description":"A regenerative economic model&amp;mdash;the circular economy&amp;mdash; is starting to help companies create more value while reducing their dependence on scarce resources.","collectionName":"McKinsey Quarterly","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"mdash":10.965440179091631,"regen":5.482720089545816,"economy":5.482026848616839,"depend":5.481333126771467,"compani":5.480916662546665,"circular":5.4808839913495895,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"economi":5.480793232423387,"industri":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"3baf8da8-e6cf-367b-92b9-de13cea940b5","title":"Cradle to cradle: Reverse logistics strategies and opportunities across three industry sectors","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-reverse-logistics-strategies-opportunities-across-three-industry-sectors/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/cradle-cradle-reverse-logistics-strategies-opportunities-across-three-industry-sectors/","creator":"Sameer Kumar, Valora Putnam","description":"Manufacturers have experienced institutional pressures in the form of market and regulatory demands to conform to the standards dictated by environmental regulations.

Where eco-efficiency and zero emission seek to reduce the unintended negative consequences of processes of production and consumption, eco-effectiveness is a positive agenda for the conception and production of goods and services that incorporate social, economic, and environmental benefit, enabling triple top line growth. Eco-effectiveness moves beyond zero emission approaches by focusing on the development of products and industrial systems that maintain or enhance the quality and productivity of materials through subsequent life cycles. The concept of eco-effectiveness also addresses the major shortcomings of eco-efficiency approaches: their inability to address the necessity for fundamental redesign of material flows, their inherent antagonism towards long-term economic growth and innovation, and their insufficiency in addressing toxicity issues. A central component of the eco-effectiveness concept, cradle-to-cradle design provides a practical design framework for creating products and industrial systems in a positive relationship with ecological health and abundance, and long-term economic growth. Against this background, the transition to eco-effective industrial systems is a five-step process beginning with an elimination of undesirable substances and ultimately calling for a reinvention of products by reconsidering how they may optimally fulfill the need or needs for which they are actually intended while simultaneously being supportive of ecological and social systems. This process necessitates the creation of an eco-effective system of \"nutrient\" management to coordinate the material flows amongst actors in the product system. The concept of intelligent materials pooling illustrates how such a system might take shape, in reality. ?? 2006.","collectionName":"Journal of Cleaner Production","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"eco":60.29055323290167,"product":49.326531526171465,"system":43.84551788047347,"emiss":21.92334926543683,"materi":21.923196667650245,"zero":16.44441572893765,"cradle":16.443999380314402,"cradl":16.443305337512,"to":16.442958255889586,"growth":16.44269791831837,"effici":16.44265197404877,"industri":16.44218849685013,"flow":10.961872996219695,"social":10.961674632718415,"insuffici":5.482720089545816,"abund":5.482720089545816,"antagon":5.482720089545816,"inabl":5.482720089545816,"reinvent":5.482720089545816,"shortcom":5.482720089545816,"elimin":5.482026848616839,"resign":5.482026848616839,"agenda":5.482026848616839,"necess":5.482026848616839,"innov":5.481680047850402,"toxic":5.481680047850402,"substanc":5.481680047850402,"creation":5.481680047850402,"shape":5.481333126771467,"line":5.4812339843533024,"background":5.481159621088721,"good":5.481101779170666,"cycle":5.481055503227208,"consequ":5.481055503227208,"compon":5.481055503227208,"transition":5.481055503227208,"move":5.481017639498762,"health":5.481017639498762,"consumpt":5.4808993061061235,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"life":5.480828299348617,"manag":5.480793232423387,"environment":5.480751529614279,"develop":5.480740544194678,"realiti":5.480740544194678,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"213dd1eb-c862-38af-9a1d-ac24409d9278","title":"Towards the Circular Economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-22/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/towards-circular-economy-22/","creator":"Ellen Macarthur","description":"Activities over the past several years, however, clearly show that CE is emerging as an economic strategy rather than a purely environmental strategy.

Various national and international initiatives to manage urban solid waste are in place and has thus have evolved at present to form an assortment of different subcomponents involving environmental, administrative, regulatory, scientific, market, technology, and socio-economic factors, which has increasing bearing on the US due to its volume and nature of discards. This paper draws together the various aspects of municipal solid waste (MSW) management as it evolved, particularly in the American society through reviewing works and findings. In many parts of the country, waste management at present, primarily involves landfilling, incineration with and without energy recovery, recycling and composting. Legislation, nature of wastes and market trends continue to redefine management operations and its responsibilities and impacts. Complexities are added to it by the nature of urban development as well. New studies and concepts like 3Rs, cradle-to-cradle, industrial ecology, and integrated waste management are adding new dimensions for solving waste problems towards achieving sustainable resource use. Local initiatives, both public and private are in the forefront of adopting alternate waste management procedures. The assistance from various government and private bodies, supporting shifts in waste management approaches, have immense value, as according to the new paradigms, nothing goes to waste. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Waste Management","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"wast":60.28860850300412,"manag":38.365552626963705,"natur":16.443052918496285,"initi":10.962203558341333,"market":10.961674632718415,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"impact":10.961565182364385,"present":10.961447907480819,"forefront":5.482720089545816,"discard":5.482720089545816,"assort":5.482720089545816,"subcompon":5.482720089545816,"msw":5.482720089545816,"legisl":5.482720089545816,"purview":5.482720089545816,"volum":5.481680047850402,"anthropogen":5.481680047850402,"usa":5.481680047850402,"inciner":5.481680047850402,"paradigm":5.481471909645883,"assist":5.481471909645883,"emphasi":5.481471909645883,"dimens":5.481471909645883,"evolut":5.481333126771467,"govern":5.481333126771467,"american":5.481333126771467,"cradle":5.481333126771467,"shift":5.481159621088721,"balanc":5.481159621088721,"complex":5.481159621088721,"bodi":5.481101779170666,"procur":5.481101779170666,"place":5.481101779170666,"cradl":5.481101779170666,"ecologi":5.481017639498762,"societi":5.481017639498762,"recoveri":5.480986085296529,"to":5.480986085296529,"trend":5.480916662546665,"oper":5.480870378035768,"region":5.48084723497695,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"time":5.480757963875433,"environment":5.480751529614279,"energi":5.480751529614279,"develop":5.480740544194678,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"work":5.480729498950042,"industri":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"1604f692-ecfe-30ba-b82f-32c8a9201970","title":"The Impact of Scale, Recycling Boundary, and Type of Waste on Symbiosis and Recycling: An Empirical Study of Japanese Eco-Towns","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/impact-scale-recycling-boundary-type-waste-symbiosis-recycling-empirical-study-japanese-ecotowns/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/impact-scale-recycling-boundary-type-waste-symbiosis-recycling-empirical-study-japanese-ecotowns/","creator":"Xudong Chen, Tsuyoshi Fujita, Satoshi Ohnishi, Minoru Fujii, Yong Geng","description":"Innovativewaste recycling through industrial processes such as industrial and urban symbiosis has long been practiced and recently received much attention in the field of industrial ecology, with researchers making efforts to identify key contributing factors to successful industrial symbiosis. By analyzing 88 sample recycling projects in 23 eco-towns in Japan, this article focuses on the factors of project scale, recycling boundary, and types of waste in relationship to environmental benefits and operational performance. The results showed that larger eco-towns achieved more savings of virgin materials and higher stability in operation. Large-scale projects tended to locate closer to the users of recycled products than did small-scale projects. For treating similar types of waste, projects producing recycled products for special users (e.g., feedstock to a blast furnace for iron production) tended to locate closer to the users than those not producing for special users. The type of waste had a strong effect on the savings of virgin materials and recycling boundaries, while local factors had significant impacts on operational performance. The results also showed that agglomeration did not significantly contribute to the environmental benefits or operational performance of eco-town projects. Another finding was that national agencies were helpful for facilitating cross-prefecture transportation and long-distance transaction of wastes. Implications of the findings are also discussed.","collectionName":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"project":32.88539583663674,"wast":27.40391295591096,"town":21.930880358183263,"eco":21.92383753923697,"user":21.923031855501733,"industri":21.92291799580017,"boundari":16.44441572893765,"symbiosi":16.44257459263578,"perform":16.442333407760135,"product":16.442177175390487,"save":10.962943819291766,"benefit":10.961767982699179,"materi":10.961598333825123,"impact":10.961565182364385,"environment":10.961503059228558,"innovativewast":5.482720089545816,"transact":5.482720089545816,"prefectur":5.482720089545816,"agglomer":5.482720089545816,"furnac":5.482026848616839,"agenc":5.482026848616839,"iron":5.482026848616839,"blast":5.482026848616839,"cross":5.481680047850402,"stabil":5.481680047850402,"festock":5.481471909645883,"japan":5.481471909645883,"transport":5.481159621088721,"ecologi":5.481017639498762,"effort":5.480986085296529,"attent":5.480936498109847,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"oper":5.480870378035768}},{"id":"f7a8c0af-6e4a-3edb-9a6b-ce23da6731dc","title":"Ecological utilization of leather tannery waste with circular economy model","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-utilization-leather-tannery-waste-circular-economy-model/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-utilization-leather-tannery-waste-circular-economy-model/","creator":"Jing Hu, Zuobing Xiao, Rujun Zhou, Weijun Deng, Mingxi Wang, Shuangshuang Ma","description":"Circular economy (CE) focuses on resource-productivity and eco-efficiency improvement in a comprehensive way, especially on the industrial structure optimization of new technology development and application, equipment renewal and management renovation.

The optimism is further encouraged by leading environmental engineering concepts, including cradle-to-cradle and industrial ecology, as well as broader frameworks, such as natural capitalism and the circular economy. This paper explores the viability of their promise from a biophysical perspective, which is based on insights from system dynamics and thermodynamics. Such an ecological reality check is generally ignored or underestimated in the literature on aforementioned concepts and frameworks. The paper ultimately reflects on what role society can realistically assign to technology for resolving its ecological concerns. While environmental engineering undoubtedly has something to offer, it will end up chasing its tail if the social and economic forces driving up production and consumption are not addressed.","collectionName":"Real-World Economics Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"technologi":16.442214374311718,"system":16.442069205177553,"thermodynam":10.965440179091631,"engineering":10.962666253542935,"perspect":10.962111006454416,"consumpt":10.961798612212247,"circular":10.961767982699179,"economi":10.961586464846773,"environment":10.961503059228558,"product":10.961451450260325,"discour":5.482720089545816,"viabil":5.482720089545816,"check":5.482026848616839,"promis":5.482026848616839,"tail":5.482026848616839,"sustain":5.482026848616839,"confid":5.482026848616839,"optim":5.481680047850402,"concern":5.481680047850402,"capit":5.481471909645883,"dynamic":5.481333126771467,"cradle":5.481333126771467,"cradl":5.481101779170666,"offer":5.481101779170666,"ecologi":5.481017639498762,"societi":5.481017639498762,"to":5.480986085296529,"forc":5.480959384809243,"social":5.4808373163592075,"impact":5.480782591182193,"role":5.480761464853082,"realiti":5.480740544194678,"industri":5.480729498950042,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"2fe8fbb4-9c3f-32be-a642-372cb12cd387","title":"Industrial symbiosis and waste recovery in an Indian industrial area","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/industrial-symbiosis-waste-recovery-indian-industrial-area/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/industrial-symbiosis-waste-recovery-indian-industrial-area/","creator":"Ariana Bain, Megha Shenoy, Weslynne Ashton, Marian Chertow","description":"Recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals, often dismissed as wastes, are common in India and other industrializing countries largely due to lower associated costs. Some wastes are reused within the facility where they are generated, others are reused directly by nearby industrial facilities, and some are recycled via the formal and informal recycling markets. Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals. It quantifies the generation of waste materials from 42 companies as well as the materials that are directly traded across facilities and those that are recycled or disposed. This study encompasses a business cluster in Mysore in the State of Karnataka, and is the first in India to thoroughly quantify material flows to identify existing symbiotic connections in an industrial area. Examined industries in this industrial area generate 897,210 metric tons of waste residuals annually, and recovered 99.5% of these, 81% with reused by the companies that generated them, with one company, a sugar refinery, processing most of this amount. Geographic data show that operations within 20km of the industrial area receive over 90% of residuals exiting facility gates. Two-thirds of this amount goes directly to other economic actors for reuse. This study makes key contributions to the literature in distinguishing how particular types of materials are reused in different ways, the geographic extent of symbiotic activities and the important role of the informal sector in industrial waste management in industrializing regions. &amp;copy; 2010 Elsevier B.V.","collectionName":"Resources, Conservation and Recycling","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"industri":65.76875398740052,"materi":32.88479500147537,"wast":32.88469554709316,"facil":21.926720191401607,"residu":21.926720191401607,"india":16.446080545850517,"recoveri":16.442958255889586,"compani":16.442749987639996,"firm":10.962203558341333,"flow":10.961872996219695,"symbiosi":10.96171639509052,"km":5.482720089545816,"indian":5.482720089545816,"karnataka":5.482720089545816,"cornerston":5.482720089545816,"mysore":5.482720089545816,"south":5.482720089545816,"geograph":5.482026848616839,"refineri":5.482026848616839,"sugar":5.482026848616839,"gate":5.482026848616839,"quantifi":5.482026848616839,"inter":5.481680047850402,"connect":5.481471909645883,"ton":5.481471909645883,"cluster":5.481333126771467,"contribut":5.4812339843533024,"exchang":5.481159621088721,"busi":5.481017639498762,"extent":5.480986085296529,"copi":5.4808993061061235,"oper":5.480870378035768,"ar":5.48085819754526,"region":5.48084723497695,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"market":5.4808373163592075,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"manag":5.480793232423387,"role":5.480761464853082,"energi":5.480751529614279}},{"id":"e0d84708-9f4e-3dcb-9175-fe4888ca1d0c","title":"Regional industrial ecology: examples from regional economic systems of forest industry and energy supply in Finland.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/regional-industrial-ecology-examples-regional-economic-systems-forest-industry-energy-supply-finland/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/regional-industrial-ecology-examples-regional-economic-systems-forest-industry-energy-supply-finland/","creator":"J Korhonen","description":"Industrial ecology (IE) promotes the development of industrial systems based on recycling of matter and cascading of energy through cooperation.

Waste energy from electricity production is used for production of heat and process steam. Regional city energy supply systems in Finland are also to a large extent arranged around power plants that utilise waste energy. The potential of combining the forest industry system with the energy supply systems of cities is considered and the conditions for success in the Finnish case are discussed.","collectionName":"Journal of environmental management","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2001","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"industri":43.84583599160034,"energi":38.36526070729995,"system":32.884138410355106,"forest":21.926720191401607,"finland":16.446080545850517,"wast":16.44234777354658,"utilis":10.965440179091631,"mill":10.965440179091631,"citi":10.963360095700803,"plant":10.962467968706605,"power":10.962035278997524,"ecologi":10.962035278997524,"region":10.9616944699539,"product":10.961451450260325,"ie":5.482720089545816,"pulp":5.482720089545816,"saw":5.482720089545816,"mil":5.482720089545816,"forestri":5.482026848616839,"steam":5.482026848616839,"ecosystem":5.481471909645883,"heat":5.481471909645883,"matter":5.481333126771467,"cooper":5.481333126771467,"success":5.481159621088721,"electr":5.481055503227208,"extent":5.480986085296529,"condition":5.480986085296529,"compani":5.480916662546665,"materi":5.480799166912561,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"develop":5.480740544194678}},{"id":"995d5c0b-5471-3efe-8317-1cfa8358b31b","title":"Promoting industrial symbiosis network through public-private partnership: A case study of TEDA","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/promoting-industrial-symbiosis-network-through-publicprivate-partnership-case-study-teda/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/promoting-industrial-symbiosis-network-through-publicprivate-partnership-case-study-teda/","creator":"Yu Qi, Huiming Li, Junfeng Wang","description":"As Circular Economy (CE) and sustainable development have been widely recognized in the world, industrial solid waste exchange as a sort of typical industrial symbiosis phenomenon is being opened, mined and utmost importance for resources-saving and environment-friendly society. Commercial businesses and manufacturers are under pressure to be responsible both environmentally and economically in China; the increasing cost of industrial solid waste treatment has led local governments to examine if this service is best provided by the public sector or can better be provided by the private sector. Public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising alternative to improve industrial solid waste management performance with privately owned enterprises often outperforming publicly owned ones. In 2004, an EU-China Environmental Management Cooperation Program (EMCP) of state government agencies, private business, not-for-profits and educational institutions met to discuss the potential for a industrial solid waste exchange in Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) EIP, China. This paper discusses public-private partnerships as a method in which private sector working with government, private business, and educational organizations developed a collaborative statewide program involving the exchange of materials from manufacturers and commercial business in TEDA EIP. The paper also figures out the case of industrial symbiosis network in TEDA and the benefits and challenges gained by related behavior activities during the process of production, development and evolvement of industrial symbiosis network. Analysis of alternatives for private sector involvement in waste management is considered and management approaches are outlined.","collectionName":"3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, iCBBE 2009","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"industri":43.84583599160034,"wast":27.40391295591096,"ta":21.928107394467357,"busi":21.924070557995048,"symbiosi":21.92343279018104,"manag":21.923172929693546,"partnership":16.448160268637448,"priv":16.448160268637448,"govern":16.443999380314402,"exchang":16.44347886326616,"network":16.44280949432954,"china":16.44280949432954,"develop":16.442221632584033,"manufactur":10.964053697233679,"eip":10.962943819291766,"program":10.962111006454416,"not":5.482720089545816,"commerci":5.482720089545816,"emcp":5.482720089545816,"sort":5.482720089545816,"evolv":5.482720089545816,"technolog":5.482026848616839,"profit":5.482026848616839,"involv":5.482026848616839,"for":5.482026848616839,"agenc":5.482026848616839,"alternatif":5.482026848616839,"eu":5.481680047850402,"tianjin":5.481680047850402,"pressur":5.481680047850402,"treatment":5.481471909645883,"figur":5.481471909645883,"ce":5.481471909645883,"cooper":5.481333126771467,"enterpri":5.481333126771467,"institut":5.481159621088721,"econom":5.481159621088721,"organ":5.481101779170666,"societi":5.481017639498762,"behavior":5.480959384809243,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"circular":5.4808839913495895,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"materi":5.480799166912561,"economi":5.480793232423387,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"environment":5.480751529614279,"world":5.480727571894862,"product":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"622a9a8a-fa64-3c75-9faa-2dfd86c15e80","title":"Developing country experience with industrial symbiosis: A case study of The Beijiang Power plant complex in Tianjin, China","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/developing-country-experience-industrial-symbiosis-case-study-beijiang-power-plant-complex-tianjin-c/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/developing-country-experience-industrial-symbiosis-case-study-beijiang-power-plant-complex-tianjin-c/","creator":"Peng Mei Li","description":"Industrial symbiosis activities are being implemented in the philosophy of circular economy in China.

In these types of setting, industrial ecology is also often known as industrial symbiosis (IS). The proximity of companies in industrial estates facilitates the linking of utilities and the exchange of wastes and by-products, which may eventually be useful inputs for adjacent industrial processes. The typical model that has been applied in several regions of the world is one where an anchor-tenant organization with energy and by-product linkages is connected to companies physically located nearby. In the case of biomass symbiosis, however, the resource chains are not explicitly arranged by their industrial setting and the supply of waste and by-products is able to be organized in a more scattered way.\\nIn this article, the role of industrial symbiosis is analyzed in respect of the planned industrial symbiosis activities in the Rotterdam Harbour and Industry Complex in the Netherlands and in the application of renewable energy in the &amp;Ouml;sterg&amp;ouml;tland region in Sweden.\\nThe objective of this article is to discuss the similarities and differences between the planned industrial symbiosis activities in Rotterdam and the unplanned biomass and industrial symbiosis activities in the &amp;Ouml;sterg&amp;ouml;tland region. By presenting this knowledge in this article, it is anticipated that further development of industrial symbiosis application processes may be achieved.

The process is based on the dissolution of the WSW in aqueous SO2 solution. The research reported here concentrated on the effect of some important operational parameters on dissolution process. The parameters investigated and their ranges were as follows: SO2 gas flow rate (V); 38-590 ml/min, stirring speed (W); 100-1000 rpm, reaction temperature (T); 13-60 &amp;deg;C, reaction time (t); 1-16 min, and solid-liquid ratio (S/L); 0.1-0.5 g/ml. The results showed that the dissolution rate increased with increasing W, V, and S/L and decreasing T. The best dissolution conditions were found to be V = 325 ml/min, W = 600 rpm, t = 6 min, T = 21 &amp;deg;C, and S/L = 0.1 g/ml. Separation of Zn from Cd involved precipitation of ZnSO3 from a mixture solution. The best pH level for the precipitation was observed to be 6. &amp;copy; 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Integrating industrial symbiosis into the corporate development plans to optimize materials and energy flows is a feasible strategy for many corporations in their transition between nonsustainable and sustainable development. By constructing industrial ecosystems, Nanning Sugar Co., Ltd. in China, has achieved the successful transition from a traditional corporation to a sustainable corporation, or rather, a circular corporation. This study expounds on its whole transition course to a circular complex in the past decade, in which four factors are essential to making this symbiosis achievable: rational production structures; raw materials advantages; technical supports and correct diversification. The corporation is in charge of almost all the aspects of its affiliated companies and the management mode, in particular, differing from that of industrial symbiosis systems in Kalundborg, is considered another potential factor contributing to the corporate success. The transition mode in question is hoped to point to a feasible development path for similar corporations. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry. &amp;copy; 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In Jinqiao EIP, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, an industrial symbiosis, based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil, was proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP. It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel. For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used and different scenarios were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Human toxicity air (HTA) and Total Environmental Impact Potential (TEIP) of the system. Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14%, the proposed industrial symbiosis has the least environmental impact. Compared with the current situation (sludge is landfilled), co-combustion of dried sludge and re-refined oil with coal at optimal scale will release less CO2, CH4, NOx, N2O and CO, but more SO2, H2S, NH3, HCl, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and heavy metals. &amp;copy; 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It has become important for EIPs to quantitatively evaluate the CE performance of the production chain while also seeking specific measures that could promote resources utilization efficiency. In this paper, we combine the substance flow analysis (SFA) approach with the resource productivity (RP) indicator to evaluate the contribution of IS to the development of circular economy. Through questionnaires and field surveys of key enterprises in Suzhou New District (SND), a substance flow analysis and resource productivity indicator were developed for core materials (copper, water and energy) in printed circuit boards (PCB) production under the excluding waste utilization scenario and including waste utilization scenario. The results show that the RPCu of chain from electrolytic copper production enterprises (ECPE) to electrolytic copper foil production enterprises is respectively 21.38 and 23.15 thousand yuan per ton, from ECPE to copper clad laminate (CCL) production enterprises is respectively 64.15 and 71.32 thousand yuan per ton, and from ECPE to PCB production enterprises is respectively 176.47and 211.21 thousand yuan per ton under the two scenarios. RP is enhanced by prolonging the industrial production chain and the RP under the excluding waste utilization scenario is higher than the including waste utilization scenario for the same chain, which can be achieved through greater IS. Finally we propose further implications on developing CE in EIPs. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Harnessing coal, oil and gas, the energy resources contained in the store of our spaceship, Earth, has prompted a dramatic expansion in energy use and a substantial improvement in the quality of life of billions of individuals in some regions of the world. Powering our civilization with fossil fuels has been very convenient, but now we know that it entails severe consequences. We treat fossil fuels as a resource that anyone anywhere can extract and use in any fashion, and Earth's atmosphere, soil and oceans as a dump for their waste products, including more than 30 Gt/y of carbon dioxide. At present, environmental legacy rather than consistence of exploitable reserves, is the most dramatic problem posed by the relentless increase of fossil fuel global demand. Harmful effects on the environment and human health, usually not incorporated into the pricing of fossil fuels, include immediate and short-term impacts related to their discovery, extraction, transportation, distribution, and burning as well as climate change that are spread over time to future generations or over space to the entire planet. In this essay, several aspects of the fossil fuel legacy are discussed, such as alteration of the carbon cycle, carbon dioxide rise and its measurement, greenhouse effect, anthropogenic climate change, air pollution and human health, geoengineering proposals, land and water degradation, economic problems, indirect effects on the society, and the urgent need of regulatory efforts and related actions to promote a gradual transition out of the fossil fuel era. While manufacturing sustainable solar fuels appears to be a longer-time perspective, alternatives energy sources already exist that have the potential to replace fossil fuels as feedstocks for electricity production.","collectionName":"Chemistry - An Asian Journal","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"fuel":54.80793232423387,"fossil":49.32713909181048,"energi":21.923006118457117,"legaci":16.448160268637448,"carbon":16.443166509681625,"earth":10.965440179091631,"dioxid":10.964053697233679,"health":10.962035278997524,"climat":10.961872996219695,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"chang":10.961586464846773,"product":10.961451450260325,"human":10.961421519684295,"alter":5.482720089545816,"spaceship":5.482720089545816,"planet":5.482720089545816,"longer":5.482720089545816,"propos":5.482720089545816,"civil":5.482720089545816,"dump":5.482720089545816,"fashion":5.482720089545816,"atmospher":5.482720089545816,"ocean":5.482720089545816,"exploit":5.482026848616839,"soil":5.482026848616839,"mankind":5.482026848616839,"spread":5.482026848616839,"alternatif":5.482026848616839,"degrad":5.482026848616839,"consist":5.482026848616839,"era":5.482026848616839,"store":5.482026848616839,"expans":5.482026848616839,"anyon":5.482026848616839,"anthropogen":5.481680047850402,"tim":5.481680047850402,"air":5.481680047850402,"discoveri":5.481680047850402,"festock":5.481471909645883,"reserv":5.481471909645883,"extract":5.481471909645883,"land":5.481333126771467,"billion":5.481333126771467,"gt":5.481333126771467,"pollution":5.481333126771467,"transport":5.481159621088721,"improv":5.481159621088721,"water":5.481159621088721,"coal":5.481159621088721,"rise":5.481159621088721,"individu":5.481055503227208,"consequ":5.481055503227208,"greenhous":5.481055503227208,"electr":5.481055503227208,"perspect":5.481055503227208,"transition":5.481055503227208,"cycle":5.481055503227208,"space":5.481017639498762,"oil":5.481017639498762,"action":5.481017639498762,"societi":5.481017639498762,"distribut":5.480986085296529,"effort":5.480986085296529,"demand":5.480936498109847,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"ga":5.4808839913495895,"increas":5.480870378035768,"region":5.48084723497695,"life":5.480828299348617,"impact":5.480782591182193,"wast":5.480782591182193,"time":5.480757963875433,"environment":5.480751529614279,"world":5.480727571894862,"present":5.4807239537404095,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"eef81e67-b1e1-35fc-af22-9e4fb2361d05","title":"Oil shale and climate policy in the shift to a low carbon and more resilient economy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/oil-shale-climate-policy-shift-low-carbon-more-resilient-economy/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/oil-shale-climate-policy-shift-low-carbon-more-resilient-economy/","creator":"D. Pasqualini, A. M. Bassi","description":"Policy makers worldwide are recently debating options to implement an effective climate policy that would put a cap on green house gas emissions. At the same time, investors are carefully evaluating the profitability of unconventional fossil fuels such as shale oil. To enhance the understanding of the impacts of a climate policy such as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, on oil shale production - and vice versa - we have customized an integrated assessment model, the Climate and Energy Assessment for Resiliency model for Unconventional Fossil Fuels to the U.S. Western Energy Corridor. Our analysis indicates that while the bill would increase the production cost of oil shale, the industry remains highly profitable in the longer-term, generating a potential profit of about $10 to $16 billion per year by 2040 at 2.5. million barrels per day. These results suggest that the oil shale industry may comfortably face the enactment of a carbon policy, albeit with some caveats. Furthermore, while its potential economic impact on non-compliant industries may be severe, it would generate mounting profits for those achieving energy efficiency gains, thereby increasing the profitability of energy efficiency investments. ?? 2013.","collectionName":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"shale":27.413600447729078,"oil":27.40508819749381,"polici":27.404186581796036,"energi":27.403757648071398,"profit":21.928107394467357,"climat":21.92374599243939,"industri":16.44218849685013,"carbon":10.962111006454416,"assess":10.961872996219695,"effici":10.961767982699179,"fuel":10.961586464846773,"impact":10.961565182364385,"product":10.961451450260325,"bill":5.482720089545816,"cap":5.482720089545816,"enact":5.482720089545816,"clean":5.482720089545816,"vice":5.482720089545816,"compli":5.482720089545816,"caveat":5.482720089545816,"barrel":5.482720089545816,"invest":5.482026848616839,"maker":5.482026848616839,"resili":5.482026848616839,"hous":5.482026848616839,"investor":5.482026848616839,"corridor":5.482026848616839,"face":5.481680047850402,"secur":5.481680047850402,"million":5.481680047850402,"billion":5.481333126771467,"act":5.481333126771467,"american":5.481333126771467,"shift":5.481159621088721,"gain":5.481101779170666,"option":5.481101779170666,"non":5.480936498109847,"ga":5.4808839913495895,"emiss":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"economi":5.480793232423387,"fossil":5.480793232423387,"time":5.480757963875433}},{"id":"7bd1936b-4154-34d3-a293-da44f31b2951","title":"Depletion of fossil fuels and anthropogenic climate change-A review","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/depletion-fossil-fuels-anthropogenic-climate-changea-review/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/depletion-fossil-fuels-anthropogenic-climate-changea-review/","creator":"Mikael H&amp;ouml;&amp;ouml;k, Xu Tang","description":"Future scenarios with significant anthropogenic climate change also display large increases in world production of fossil fuels, the principal CO2 emission source. Meanwhile, fossil fuel depletion has also been identified as a future challenge. This chapter reviews the connection between these two issues and concludes that limits to availability of fossil fuels will set a limit for mankind's ability to affect the climate. However, this limit is unclear as various studies have reached quite different conclusions regarding future atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by fossil fuel limitations. It is concluded that the current set of emission scenarios used by the IPCC and others is perforated by optimistic expectations on future fossil fuel production that are improbable or even unrealistic. The current situation, where climate models largely rely on emission scenarios detached from the reality of supply and its inherent problems are problematic. In fact, it may even mislead planners and politicians into making decisions that mitigate one problem but make the other one worse. It is important to understand that the fossil energy problem and the anthropogenic climate change problem are tightly connected and need to be treated as two interwoven challenges necessitating a holistic solution. &amp;copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Energy Policy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2013","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"fossil":38.365552626963705,"fuel":32.88475939454032,"climat":27.404682490549238,"anthropogen":16.445040143551203,"emiss":16.442511949077623,"depletion":10.964053697233679,"co":10.96171639509052,"chang":10.961586464846773,"product":10.961451450260325,"change":5.482720089545816,"mislead":5.482720089545816,"ipcc":5.482720089545816,"concentr":5.482720089545816,"mankind":5.482026848616839,"politician":5.482026848616839,"avail":5.481471909645883,"planner":5.481471909645883,"connect":5.481471909645883,"decision":5.4812339843533024,"expect":5.4812339843533024,"increa":5.481055503227208,"solution":5.480959384809243,"copi":5.4808993061061235,"abil":5.48084723497695,"displai":5.4808373163592075,"energi":5.480751529614279,"realiti":5.480740544194678,"world":5.480727571894862}},{"id":"5ca8604a-cf6b-36dc-a64b-da9d53422d7d","title":"Lean consumption","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/lean-consumption/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/lean-consumption/","creator":"James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones","description":"During the past 20 years, the real price of most consumer goods has fallen worldwide, the variety of goods and the range of sales channels offering them have continued to grow, and product quality has steadily improved. So why is consumption often so frustrating? It doesn't have to be--and shouldn't be--the authors say. They argue that it's time to apply lean thinking to the processes of consumption--to give consumers the full value they want from goods and services with the greatest efficiency and the least pain. Companies may think they save time and money by off-loading work to the consumer but, in fact, the opposite is true. By streamlining their systems for providing goods and services, and by making it easier for customers to buy and use those products and services, a growing number of companies are actually lowering costs while saving everyone time. In the process, these businesses are learning more about their customers, strengthening consumer loyalty, and attracting new customers who are defecting from less user-friendly competitors. The challenge lies with the retailers, service providers, manufacturers, and suppliers that are not used to looking at total cost from the standpoint of the consumer and even less accustomed to working with customers to optimize the consumption process. Lean consumption requires a fundamental shift in the way companies think about the relationship between provision and consumption, and the role their customers play in these processes.

Lean production has clearly triumphed over similar obstacles in recent years to become the dominant global manufacturing model. Lean consumption, its logical companion, can't be far behind.","collectionName":"Harvard Business Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"consumpt":38.366295142742864,"consum":32.8888314578753,"custom":27.413600447729078,"lean":21.930880358183263,"good":21.924407116682666,"compani":21.92366665018666,"servic":21.92334926543683,"time":16.4422738916263,"product":16.442177175390487,"be":10.962943819291766,"relatship":10.961767982699179,"cost":10.961656598697234,"shouldn":5.482720089545816,"standpoint":5.482720089545816,"sale":5.482720089545816,"everyon":5.482720089545816,"channel":5.482720089545816,"provid":5.482720089545816,"provision":5.482720089545816,"supplier":5.482720089545816,"doesn":5.482720089545816,"retail":5.482720089545816,"competitor":5.482720089545816,"companion":5.482720089545816,"loyalti":5.482720089545816,"pain":5.482026848616839,"manufactur":5.482026848616839,"th":5.481680047850402,"monei":5.481680047850402,"price":5.481471909645883,"shift":5.481159621088721,"obstacl":5.481055503227208,"natur":5.481017639498762,"busi":5.481017639498762,"varieti":5.481017639498762,"to":5.480986085296529,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"chang":5.480793232423387,"role":5.480761464853082,"work":5.480729498950042,"real":5.480725725130163,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"2b7259a7-c5b5-31ae-8db4-eef62f373ff1","title":"An econometrics view of worldwide fossil fuel consumption and the role of US","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/econometrics-view-worldwide-fossil-fuel-consumption-role/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/econometrics-view-worldwide-fossil-fuel-consumption-role/","creator":"Shahriar Shafiee, Erkan Topal","description":"Crude oil, coal and gas, known as fossil fuels, play a crucial role in the global economy. This paper proposes new econometrics modelling to demonstrate the trend of fossil fuels consumption. The main variables affecting consumption trends are: world reserves, the price of fossil fuels, US production and US net imports. All variables have been analysed individually for more than half a century. The research found that while the consumption of fossil fuels worldwide has increased trends in the US production and net imports have been dependent on the type of fossil fuels. Most of the US coal and gas production has been for domestic use, which is why it does not have a strong influence on worldwide fossil fuel prices. Moreover, the reserves of fossil fuels have not shown any diminution during the last couple of decades and predictions that they were about to run out are not substantiated. The nominal and real price of fossil fuels was found to change depending on the type. Finally, estimates of three econometric models for the consumption of fossil fuels from 1949 to 2006 are presented which identify the effects of significant variables.

Carbon dioxide is by far the largest of these by volume, representing about 80% of the total emissions of these six gases. Almost all carbon dioxide is emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels and OECD countries account for over half of the total carbon dioxide emission in the world while an additional four countries (Brazil, China, India and Russia) together account for a further quarter of the global total. Many policies designed to reduce these emissions set emission reduction goals based on some previous level (e.g. 1990 in the case of Kyoto for many countries) which is used as a benchmark for success and compliance to the protocol. But changes in emissions at the national level can occur for many reasons: including the relocation of production abroad, and/or by import substitution. This may have a negligible impact on global emissions but, if the imports use more GHG intensive production processes than the domestically produced goods that they displace, global emissions could well be higher. The objective of this paper is to explore the role of trade in goods in this context by creating an indicator that estimates CO2 emissions related to domestic demand, for 24 countries (responsible for 80% of global CO2 emissions), as a complement to the more common indicator of emissions associated with domestic production of emissions, such as that used in the Kyoto Protocol. Using conservative assumptions the paper shows that estimates of CO2 emissions generated to satisfy domestic demand in the OECD in 1995 were 5% higher than emissions related to production. To put this figure into perspective only six countries in the world directly emitted more CO2 in 1995.","collectionName":"Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2003","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"emiss":76.7317224290289,"dioxid":21.928107394467357,"carbon":21.92422201290883,"co":21.92343279018104,"countri":21.92334926543683,"product":21.92290290052065,"kyoto":16.448160268637448,"protocol":16.445040143551203,"good":16.443305337512,"oecd":10.965440179091631,"trade":10.964053697233679,"ghg":10.962467968706605,"demand":10.961872996219695,"ga":10.961767982699179,"chang":10.961586464846773,"world":10.961455143789724,"emisss":5.482720089545816,"brazil":5.482720089545816,"reloc":5.482720089545816,"countries":5.482720089545816,"quarter":5.482720089545816,"russia":5.482720089545816,"india":5.482026848616839,"complianc":5.482026848616839,"complem":5.481680047850402,"volum":5.481680047850402,"figur":5.481471909645883,"benchmark":5.481471909645883,"intern":5.4812339843533024,"success":5.481159621088721,"substitut":5.481159621088721,"combust":5.481159621088721,"ruction":5.481055503227208,"greenhous":5.481055503227208,"perspect":5.481055503227208,"effort":5.480986085296529,"climat":5.480936498109847,"china":5.480936498109847,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"context":5.480799166912561,"fuel":5.480793232423387,"fossil":5.480793232423387,"impact":5.480782591182193,"role":5.480761464853082,"object":5.4807175366040894}},{"id":"15160706-d598-3caf-be3c-cd5d0fa5233e","title":"The role of bio-fuels in satisfying US transportation fuel demands","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-biofuels-satisfying-transportation-fuel-demands/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/role-biofuels-satisfying-transportation-fuel-demands/","creator":"Berk Akinci, Paul G.

There have been fewer studies of unintended consequences stemming from these enterprises, although several research groups have begun questioning the appropriate levels of subsidies provided to individuals and companies to stimulate production of bio-fuels. In this paper, the production capacities for bio-fuels-ethanol and biodiesel-are evaluated for their potential impact on the US energy market. Several ramifications of these technologies are reviewed. This study concludes that ethanol or biodiesel production do not appear scalable to make a significant difference on the US fossil fuel demand for transportation. Aspects of this study point to systemic changes that may be required in lifestyles and attitudes toward energy consumption. Finally, comments regarding US energy policies are included to stimulate discussion. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

By looking into a limited number of attempts at substitution and restoration of ecosystem services (e.g. artificial reefs, aquaculture in mangroves, artificial seawalls), we address the questions: (1) To what degree can technologies substitute for ecosystem services in the seascape? (2) How can ecosystem restoration reestablish not only the functions of direct value to humans, but also the ability of the systems to cope with future disturbance? Substitutions often imply the replacement of a function provided free by a solar powered, self-repairing resilient ecosystem, with a fossil-fuel-powered, expensive, artificial substitute that needs maintenance. Further, restoration usually does not focus on large-scale processes such as the physical, biological and biogeochemical interactions between mangroves, seagrass beds and coral reefs. Nonetheless, restoration might be the only viable management alternative when the system is essentially locked into an undesired community state (stability domain) after a phase-shift. We conclude that ecosystem services cannot be readily replaced, restored or sustained without extensive knowledge of the dynamics, multifunctionality and interconnectedness of ecosystems. &amp;copy; 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Total fossil fuels, petroleum products, and natural gas consumption are used as three proxies for energy consumption. Empirical results suggest a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP and two proxies of energy consumption (petroleum products and natural gas consumption) to carbon emissions, and no Granger causality running from total fossil fuels consumption to carbon emissions in the long run. The results also show that carbon emissions, petroleum products, and total fossil fuels consumption do not lead to economic growth, though gas consumption does. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Energy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"consumpt":49.32809375495511,"emiss":27.404186581796036,"fossil":27.403966162116934,"fuel":27.403966162116934,"carbon":21.92422201290883,"petroleum":16.446080545850517,"growth":16.44269791831837,"ga":16.44265197404877,"product":16.442177175390487,"granger":10.965440179091631,"iran":10.965440179091631,"causal":10.965440179091631,"proxi":10.964053697233679,"energi":10.961503059228558,"environment":10.961503059228558,"deterior":5.482720089545816,"yamamoto":5.482720089545816,"toda":5.482720089545816,"gdp":5.482026848616839,"seri":5.482026848616839,"pollution":5.481333126771467,"econom":5.481159621088721,"interest":5.481017639498762,"attent":5.480936498109847,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"co":5.48085819754526,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"time":5.480757963875433,"human":5.480710759842148}},{"id":"3d6af089-c01c-3727-9342-fd3050622bb6","title":"COLLECTIVE-CONSUMPTION SERVICES OF INDIVIDUAL-CONSUMPTION GOODS.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/collectiveconsumption-services-individualconsumption-goods/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/collectiveconsumption-services-individualconsumption-goods/","creator":"Burton A Weisbrod","description":"The article examines collective-consumption services of individual-consumption goods.

The collective-good aspect of the commodity--in satisfying the option demand--may be viewed as an external economy from current production; that is, current production enters","collectionName":"Quarterly Journal of Economics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1964","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"consumpt":38.366295142742864,"collective":21.930880358183263,"individual":21.926720191401607,"good":21.924407116682666,"product":21.92290290052065,"commod":10.965440179091631,"servic":10.961674632718415,"purchas":5.482720089545816,"commodity":5.482720089545816,"enterpris":5.482720089545816,"mai":5.482720089545816,"welfar":5.482026848616839,"objectif":5.481680047850402,"in":5.481159621088721,"option":5.481101779170666,"observ":5.481055503227208,"varieti":5.481017639498762,"demand":5.480936498109847,"input":5.480870378035768,"social":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"economi":5.480793232423387}},{"id":"0b346079-1bf7-34ed-b87e-64cb1679cf5b","title":"Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/consumptionbased-accounting-co2-emissions/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/consumptionbased-accounting-co2-emissions/","creator":"Steven J Davis, Ken Caldeira","description":"CO(2) emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the primary cause of global warming. Much attention has been focused on the CO(2) directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO(2) emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO(2) emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO(2) emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23% of global CO(2) emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO(2), were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, &amp;gt;30% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of &amp;gt;4 tons CO(2) per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO(2) per person. In contrast, 22.5% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO(2) emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.","collectionName":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"emiss":76.7317224290289,"co":60.28944017299786,"countri":21.92334926543683,"consum":16.44441572893765,"export":10.965440179091631,"ton":10.962943819291766,"inventori":10.962943819291766,"gt":10.962666253542935,"good":10.962203558341333,"carbon":10.962111006454416,"attent":10.961872996219695,"china":10.961872996219695,"servic":10.961674632718415,"leakag":5.482720089545816,"gigatonn":5.482720089545816,"kingdom":5.482720089545816,"austria":5.482720089545816,"calcul":5.482720089545816,"switzerland":5.482720089545816,"franc":5.482720089545816,"swene":5.482026848616839,"agreem":5.482026848616839,"produc":5.482026848616839,"intens":5.481680047850402,"concern":5.481680047850402,"contrast":5.481159621088721,"inequ":5.480959384809243,"climat":5.480936498109847,"consumpt":5.4808993061061235,"market":5.4808373163592075,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"fuel":5.480793232423387,"fossil":5.480793232423387,"energi":5.480751529614279,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"06c9eadf-eeb9-3cab-bc59-b5af7e5d3cee","title":"Hydrogen as a renewable and sustainable solution in reducing global fossil fuel consumption","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/hydrogen-renewable-sustainable-solution-reducing-global-fossil-fuel-consumption/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/hydrogen-renewable-sustainable-solution-reducing-global-fossil-fuel-consumption/","creator":"Adnan Midilli, Ibrahim Dincer","description":"In this paper, hydrogen is considered as a renewable and sustainable solution for reducing global fossil fuel consumption and combating global warming and studied exergetically through a parametric performance analysis. The environmental impact results are then compared with the ones obtained for fossil fuels. In this regard, some exergetic expressions are derived depending primarily upon the exergetic utilization ratios of fossil fuels and hydrogen: the fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency, fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator. These relations incorporate predicted exergetic utilization ratios for hydrogen energy from non-fossil fuel resources such as water, etc., and are used to investigate whether or not exergetic utilization of hydrogen can significantly reduce the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient (ranging from 1 to +&amp;infin;) indicating the fossil fuel consumption and contribute to increase the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator (ranging from 0 to 1) indicating the hydrogen utilization at a certain ratio of fossil fuel utilization. In order to verify all these exergetic expressions, the actual fossil fuel consumption and production data are taken from the literature. Due to the unavailability of appropriate hydrogen data for analysis, it is assumed that the utilization ratios of hydrogen are ranged between 0 and 1. For the verification of these parameters, the variations of fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient and hydrogen based global exergetic indicator as the functions of fossil fuel based global waste exergy factor, hydrogen based global exergetic efficiency and exergetic utilization of hydrogen from non-fossil fuels are analyzed and discussed in detail. Consequently, if exergetic utilization ratio of hydrogen from non-fossil fuel sources at a certain exergetic utilization ratio of fossil fuels increases, the fossil fuel based global irreversibility coefficient will decrease and the hydrogen based global exergetic indicator will increase. &amp;copy; 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","collectionName":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"hydrogen":93.20624152227887,"fuel":93.17348495119757,"fossil":93.17348495119757,"exerget":76.75808125364142,"coeffici":21.930880358183263,"irrevers":21.930880358183263,"consumpt":21.923597224424494,"non":16.44280949432954,"express":10.963360095700803,"exergi":10.963360095700803,"solution":10.961918769618485,"effici":10.961767982699179,"increas":10.961740756071537,"wast":10.961565182364385,"energi":10.961503059228558,"unavail":5.482720089545816,"infin":5.482720089545816,"verif":5.482026848616839,"regard":5.481680047850402,"paramet":5.481471909645883,"decreas":5.481333126771467,"associ":5.481333126771467,"intern":5.4812339843533024,"water":5.481159621088721,"relat":5.481159621088721,"variat":5.481101779170666,"increa":5.481055503227208,"copi":5.4808993061061235,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"order":5.480793232423387,"impact":5.480782591182193,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"environment":5.480751529614279,"product":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"df56573d-b504-34af-a213-8d753740a5c9","title":"Do alternative energy sources displace fossil fuels?","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/alternative-energy-sources-displace-fossilfuels/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/alternative-energy-sources-displace-fossilfuels/","creator":"Richard York","description":"A fundamental, generally implicit, assumption of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and many energy analysts is that each unit of energy supplied by non-fossil-fuel sources takes the place of a unit of energy supplied by fossil-fuel sources. However, owing to the complexity of economic systems and human behaviour, it is often the case that changes aimed at reducing one type of resource consumption, either through improvements in efficiency of use or by developing substitutes, do not lead to the intended outcome when net effects are considered5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Here, I show that the average pattern across most nations of the world over the past fifty years is one where each unit of total national energy use from non-fossil-fuel sources displaced less than one-quarter of a unit of fossil-fuel energy use and, focusing specifically on electricity, each unit of electricity generated by non-fossil-fuel sources displaced less than one-tenth of a unit of fossil-fuel-generated electricity. These results challenge conventional thinking in that they indicate that suppressing the use of fossil fuel will require changes other than simply technical ones such as expanding non-fossil-fuel energy production.","collectionName":"Nature Climate Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"fuel":43.84634585938709,"fossil":43.84634585938709,"energi":38.36526070729995,"unit":32.892161091701034,"non":21.92374599243939,"electr":16.443166509681625,"chang":16.44237969727016,"one":10.962943819291766,"quart":5.482720089545816,"analyst":5.482720089545816,"fifti":5.482720089545816,"tenth":5.482720089545816,"intergovernment":5.482026848616839,"behaviour":5.481333126771467,"complex":5.481159621088721,"improv":5.481159621088721,"substitut":5.481159621088721,"place":5.481101779170666,"nation":5.481055503227208,"climat":5.480936498109847,"consumpt":5.4808993061061235,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"world":5.480727571894862,"product":5.480725725130163,"human":5.480710759842148,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"697746ae-9d9c-3c52-9613-eaf875f2f18a","title":"Ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-goods-services-coral-reef-ecosystems-5/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/ecological-goods-services-coral-reef-ecosystems-5/","creator":"Fredrik Moberg, Carl Folke","description":"This article identifies ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems, with special emphasis on how they are generated.

A review of economic valuation studies reveals that only a few of the goods and services of reefs have been captured. We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of Species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.","collectionName":"Ecological Economics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1999","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"servic":65.7700477963105,"reef":43.856214788934714,"good":27.40550889585333,"capac":16.443701953059907,"ecolog":10.963360095700803,"ecosystem":10.962943819291766,"loss":10.962943819291766,"consequ":10.962111006454416,"human":10.961421519684295,"speci":5.482720089545816,"seascape":5.482720089545816,"landscap":5.482720089545816,"buffer":5.482720089545816,"biotic":5.482720089545816,"quantiti":5.482720089545816,"resili":5.482026848616839,"valuat":5.482026848616839,"deliveri":5.482026848616839,"biogeochem":5.482026848616839,"emphasi":5.481471909645883,"compon":5.481055503227208,"recoveri":5.480986085296529,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"structur":5.480870378035768,"commun":5.480870378035768,"region":5.48084723497695,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"social":5.4808373163592075,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"impact":5.480782591182193,"world":5.480727571894862,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"2b56e50a-4b87-3daa-8795-92e2fe7cb51f","title":"Energizing historical materialism: Fossil fuels, space and the capitalist mode of production","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/energizing-historical-materialism-fossil-fuels-space-capitalist-mode-production/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/energizing-historical-materialism-fossil-fuels-space-capitalist-mode-production/","creator":"Matthew T.

Despite sustained attention to distributional conflicts between international capital and energy rich nation-states, few historical-materialists have paid attention to the relations between fossil fuel and capital accumulation in industrial capitalist societies. In opposition to ecological economic notions of fixed thermodynamic \"laws\", I first propose a dialectical conception of energy as embedded in dynamic social processes and power relations. Second, I review the historical importance of the energy shift from solar or biological sources of energy (muscles, wind, and water) to fossilized sources of energy (coal, oil, and gas). I then demonstrate how attention to fossil fuel energy forces a reexamination of the core insights of ecological Marxism and the political economy of nature. In the core argument of the paper, I reconsider the shift from biological to fossil energy as internal to the generalization and extension of capitalist social relations from two basic vantage points - (1) capitalist production based on wage labor; (2) the spatial conditions of capitalist circulation. I conclude by asking whether it is accurate to conceptualize capitalism as a \"fossil fuel mode of production\" and highlight the political urgency of a historical materialist perspective that takes seriously the importance of energy to the reproduction of capitalist social relations. ?? 2008.","collectionName":"Geoforum","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"energi":43.846012236914234,"fossil":27.403966162116934,"fuel":27.403966162116934,"relat":21.924638484354883,"product":21.92290290052065,"capit":16.44441572893765,"mode":16.443999380314402,"attent":16.44280949432954,"social":16.442511949077623,"materialist":10.965440179091631,"core":10.962943819291766,"shift":10.962319242177442,"historical":5.482720089545816,"urgenc":5.482720089545816,"conflict":5.482720089545816,"gas":5.482720089545816,"conceptu":5.482720089545816,"opposit":5.482720089545816,"marxism":5.482720089545816,"vantag":5.482720089545816,"circul":5.482720089545816,"nat":5.482720089545816,"muscl":5.482720089545816,"reexamin":5.482720089545816,"stat":5.482720089545816,"wind":5.482026848616839,"accumul":5.482026848616839,"reproduct":5.481680047850402,"law":5.481471909645883,"extens":5.481333126771467,"coal":5.481159621088721,"water":5.481159621088721,"perspect":5.481055503227208,"space":5.481017639498762,"societi":5.481017639498762,"oil":5.481017639498762,"power":5.481017639498762,"natur":5.481017639498762,"labor":5.481017639498762,"condition":5.480986085296529,"distribut":5.480986085296529,"forc":5.480959384809243,"wage":5.4808200663548945,"materi":5.480799166912561,"economi":5.480793232423387,"industri":5.480729498950042,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"feb41083-7ff9-3b46-a512-10914cdf65e3","title":"Integrated energy, environmental and financial analysis of ethanol production from cellulosic switchgrass","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/integrated-energy-environmental-financial-analysis-ethanol-production-cellulosic-switchgrass/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/integrated-energy-environmental-financial-analysis-ethanol-production-cellulosic-switchgrass/","creator":"Erika Felix, David R.

We used emergy accounting to integrate the ultimate amount of environmental, fossil fuel, and human-derived energy required to produce ethanol from switchgrass. Emergy is the total amount of energy of one form required directly and indirectly to make another form of energy. Forty-four percent of required emergy came from the environment either directly or embodied in purchased goods, 30% came from fossil fuels either directly or embodied in purchased goods, and 25% came from human-derived services indirectly. Ethanol production per petroleum use (emergy/emergy) was 4.0-to-1 under our Baseline Scenario, but dropped to 0.5-to-1 under a scenario that assumed higher input prices, lower conversion efficiencies and less waste recycling. At least 75% of total emergy was from non-renewable sources. Energy 'hidden' in indirect paths such as goods and services was 65% of the total. Cellulosic-ethanol is not a primary fuel source that substitutes for petroleum because its production relies heavily on non-renewable energy and purchased inputs. It is a means for converting natural resources to liquid fuel. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There is yet no clear idea about if and when capital goods play an important role in life cycle assessments. The present paper evaluates the contribution of capital goods in a large number and variety of product and service systems. A classification of product and service groups is proposed to give better guidance on when and where capital goods should be included or can be neglected. \nMethods. \nThe life cycle inventory database ecoinvent data v1.2 forms the basis for the assessment of the environmental importance of capital goods. The importance is assessed on the basis of several hundreds of cradle-to-gate LCAs of heat and electricity supply systems, of materials extraction and production, of agricultural products, and of transport and waste management services. The importance within product (and service) groups is evaluated with statistical methods by comparing the LCA results including and excluding capital goods. The assessment is based on characterised cumulative LCI results using the CML baseline characterisation factors of the impact categories of global warming, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, freshwater acquatic toxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, ionising radiation, and land competition, based on proxy indicators (fossil and nuclear) cumulative energy demand, and based on the endpoint indicators Eco-indicator 99 (H,A) mineral resources, human health, eco system quality and totals. \nResults. \nThe analysis confirms the fact that capital goods cannot be excluded per se. On one hand, toxicity related environmental impacts such as freshwater ecotoxicity or human toxicity are more sensitive towards an inclusion or exclusion of capital goods. On the other, certain products like photovoltaic and wind electricity are very much or even completely affected by capital goods contributions, no matter which indicator is chosen. Nuclear electricity, agricultural products and processes, and transport services often behave differently (showing a higher or lower share of capital goods contribution) than products from other sectors. \nDiscussions. \nSome indicators analysed in this paper show a rather similar behaviour across all sectors analysed. This is particularly true for 'mineral resources', and - to a lesser extent -; for 'Ecoindicator 99 total', 'acidification' and 'climate change'. On the other hand, 'land use' and 'freshwater ecotoxicity' show the most contrasting behaviour with shares of capital goods' impacts between less than 1% and more than 98%. \nRecommendations. \nCapital goods must be included in the assessment of climate change impacts of non-fossil electricity, agricultural products and processes, transport services and waste management services. They must be included in any sector regarding the assessment of toxic effects. Energy analyses (quantifying the non-renewable cumulative energy demand) of agricultural products and processes, of wooden products and of transport services should include capital goods as well. The mixing of datasets including and excluding capital goods is no problem as long as their share on total impacts is low and partial omissions do not lead to a significant imbalance in comparative assertions. \nPerspectives. \nIf in doubt whether or not to include capital goods, it is recommended to check two things: (1) whether maintenance and depreciation costs of capital equipment form a substantial part of the product price (Heijungs et al. 1992a), and (2) whether actual environmental hot spots occur along the capital goods' supply chain.","collectionName":"International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"capit":109.62943819291766,"good":104.14093380424266,"product":76.73016015182228,"servic":43.84669853087366,"assess":38.36655548676893,"impact":27.40391295591096,"toxic":21.926720191401607,"transport":21.924638484354883,"electr":21.92422201290883,"cycle":21.92422201290883,"life":21.923313197394467,"environment":21.923006118457117,"system":21.922758940236736,"ecotox":16.446080545850517,"share":16.443701953059907,"contribut":16.443701953059907,"lca":16.443305337512,"energi":16.442254588842836,"human":16.442132279526444,"nuclear":10.965440179091631,"acidif":10.964053697233679,"miner":10.964053697233679,"land":10.962666253542935,"behaviour":10.962666253542935,"eco":10.961918769618485,"non":10.961872996219695,"climat":10.961872996219695,"demand":10.961872996219695,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"chang":10.961586464846773,"manag":10.961586464846773,"fossil":10.961586464846773,"wast":10.961565182364385,"characteris":5.482720089545816,"ecoinv":5.482720089545816,"ecoind":5.482720089545816,"depreci":5.482720089545816,"omiss":5.482720089545816,"exclusion":5.482720089545816,"neglect":5.482720089545816,"hundr":5.482720089545816,"acquat":5.482720089545816,"heijung":5.482720089545816,"assert":5.482720089545816,"spot":5.482720089545816,"ind":5.482720089545816,"service":5.482720089545816,"lci":5.482720089545816,"endpoint":5.482720089545816,"cml":5.482720089545816,"radiat":5.482720089545816,"databa":5.482026848616839,"proxi":5.482026848616839,"doubt":5.482026848616839,"guidanc":5.482026848616839,"inclusion":5.482026848616839,"imbal":5.482026848616839,"photovolta":5.482026848616839,"wind":5.482026848616839,"check":5.482026848616839,"iso":5.482026848616839,"eutroph":5.482026848616839,"thing":5.481680047850402,"al":5.481680047850402,"competit":5.481680047850402,"equip":5.481680047850402,"databas":5.481680047850402,"renew":5.481680047850402,"perspectif":5.481680047850402,"mainten":5.481680047850402,"price":5.481471909645883,"scope":5.481471909645883,"baselin":5.481471909645883,"extract":5.481471909645883,"heat":5.481471909645883,"inventori":5.481471909645883,"cradle":5.481333126771467,"idea":5.481333126771467,"standard":5.481333126771467,"matter":5.481333126771467,"relev":5.4812339843533024,"chain":5.481101779170666,"classif":5.481101779170666,"dataset":5.481055503227208,"health":5.481017639498762,"varieti":5.481017639498762,"extent":5.480986085296529,"to":5.480986085296529,"qualiti":5.4808993061061235,"categori":5.4808993061061235,"cost":5.480828299348617,"materi":5.480799166912561,"role":5.480761464853082,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"1854abfc-1fee-3ca1-a37f-4fc8bc13a700","title":"Peak oil demand: The role of fuel efficiency and alternative fuels in a global oil production decline","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/peak-oil-demand-role-fuel-efficiency-alternative-fuels-global-oil-production-decline/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/peak-oil-demand-role-fuel-efficiency-alternative-fuels-global-oil-production-decline/","creator":"Adam R.

We examine the alternative possibility of reduced oil use due to improved efficiency and oil substitution. Our model uses historical relationships to project future demand for (a) transport services, (b) all liquid fuels, and (c) substitution with alternative energy carriers, including electricity. Results show great increases in passenger and freight transport activity, but less reliance on oil. Demand for liquids inputs to refineries declines significantly after 2070. By 2100 transport energy demand rises &amp;gt;1000% in Asia, while flattening in North America (+23%) and Europe (-20%). Conventional oil demand declines after 2035, and cumulative oil production is 1900 Gbbl from 2010 to 2100 (close to the U.S. Geological Survey median estimate of remaining oil, which only includes projected discoveries through 2025). These results suggest that effort is better spent to determine and influence the trajectory of oil substitution and efficiency improvement rather than to focus on oil resource scarcity. The results also imply that policy makers should not rely on liquid fossil fuel scarcity to constrain damage from climate change. However, there is an unpredictable range of emissions impacts depending on which mix of substitutes for conventional oil gains dominance-oil sands, electricity, coal-to-liquids, or others.","collectionName":"Environmental Science and Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2013","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"oil":71.2532293134839,"demand":27.404682490549238,"substitut":21.924638484354883,"fuel":21.923172929693546,"scarciti":16.448160268637448,"declin":16.445040143551203,"transport":16.44347886326616,"effici":16.44265197404877,"product":16.442177175390487,"liquid":10.964053697233679,"peak":10.963360095700803,"electr":10.962111006454416,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"energi":10.961503059228558,"sand":5.482720089545816,"geolog":5.482720089545816,"dominance":5.482720089545816,"passeng":5.482720089545816,"freight":5.482720089545816,"north":5.482720089545816,"relianc":5.482720089545816,"gbbl":5.482720089545816,"refineri":5.482026848616839,"maker":5.482026848616839,"argu":5.482026848616839,"close":5.482026848616839,"asia":5.482026848616839,"carrier":5.482026848616839,"trajectori":5.481680047850402,"discoveri":5.481680047850402,"possibl":5.481471909645883,"mix":5.481471909645883,"america":5.481471909645883,"damag":5.481471909645883,"europ":5.481333126771467,"gt":5.481333126771467,"coal":5.481159621088721,"improv":5.481159621088721,"gain":5.481101779170666,"increa":5.481055503227208,"to":5.480986085296529,"effort":5.480986085296529,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"climat":5.480936498109847,"project":5.4808993061061235,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"input":5.480870378035768,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"emiss":5.4808373163592075,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"chang":5.480793232423387,"fossil":5.480793232423387,"impact":5.480782591182193,"role":5.480761464853082}},{"id":"347d4d6e-61eb-3d15-999e-f365d9a64377","title":"The potential environmental gains from recycling waste plastics: Simulation of transferring recycling and recovery technologies to Shenyang, China","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/potential-environmental-gains-recycling-waste-plastics-simulation-transferring-recycling-recovery-te/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/potential-environmental-gains-recycling-waste-plastics-simulation-transferring-recycling-recovery-te/","creator":"Xudong Chen, Fengming Xi, Yong Geng, Tsuyoshi Fujita","description":"With the increasing attention on developing a low-carbon economy, it is necessary to seek appropriate ways on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through innovative municipal solid waste management (MSWM), such as urban symbiosis. However, quantitative assessments on the environmental benefits of urban symbiosis, especially in developing countries, are limited because only a limited number of planned synergistic activities have been successful and it is difficult to acquire detailed inventory data from private companies. This paper modifies and applies a two-step simulation system and used it to assess the potential environmental benefits, including the reduction of GHG emissions and saving of fossil fuels, by employing various Japanese plastics recycling/energy-recovery technologies in Shenyang, China. The results showed that among various recycling/energy-recovery technologies, the mechanical waste plastics recycling technology, which produces concrete formwork boards (NF boards), has the greatest potential in terms of reducing GHG emissions (1.66kg CO2e/kg plastics), whereas the technology for the production of refuse plastic fuel (RPF) has the greatest potential on saving fossil fuel consumption (0.77kgce/kg-plastics). Additional benefits can be gained by applying combined technologies that cascade the utilization of waste plastics. Moreover, the development of clean energy in conjunction with the promotion of new waste plastics recycling programs could contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Waste Management","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"plastic":32.892161091701034,"technologi":32.884428748623435,"wast":27.40391295591096,"ghg":21.92493593741321,"emiss":21.92334926543683,"fuel":21.923172929693546,"kg":16.445040143551203,"recoveri":16.442958255889586,"benefit":16.44265197404877,"fossil":16.44237969727016,"environment":16.442254588842836,"shenyang":10.965440179091631,"plastics":10.965440179091631,"energy":10.963360095700803,"ruction":10.962111006454416,"china":10.961872996219695,"simul":10.961872996219695,"consumpt":10.961798612212247,"symbiosi":10.96171639509052,"boards":5.482720089545816,"cascad":5.482720089545816,"nf":5.482720089545816,"kgce":5.482720089545816,"formwork":5.482720089545816,"rpf":5.482720089545816,"mswm":5.482026848616839,"conjunct":5.482026848616839,"board":5.481680047850402,"inventori":5.481471909645883,"low":5.4812339843533024,"gain":5.481101779170666,"carbon":5.481055503227208,"promotion":5.481055503227208,"greenhous":5.481055503227208,"program":5.481055503227208,"attent":5.480936498109847,"assess":5.480936498109847,"compani":5.480916662546665,"ga":5.4808839913495895,"co":5.48085819754526,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"manag":5.480793232423387,"economi":5.480793232423387,"energi":5.480751529614279,"develop":5.480740544194678,"product":5.480725725130163,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"3b2b8f22-9bac-3eaa-9ce0-38b5f1c32cd6","title":"Biofuels and their potential to aid the UK towards achieving emissions reduction policy targets","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/biofuels-potential-aid-uk-towards-achieving-emissions-reduction-policy-targets/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/biofuels-potential-aid-uk-towards-achieving-emissions-reduction-policy-targets/","creator":"Adolf A.

The scenarios were evaluated using hybrid lifecycle assessment developed in a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) framework. In the hybrid MRIO LCA framework, technology-specific processes in the biofuels and fossil fuels LCA systems are integrated into a generalised 2-region (UK and Rest of the World) environmental-economic input-output framework in order to account for economy-wide indirect GHG emissions in the biofuels and fossil fuels LCA systems in addition to other indirect impacts such as indirect land use change. The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel (soybean, palm, rape, waste cooking oil) and bio-ethanol (sugarcane, sugarbeet, corn) were assessed and compared to fossil fuel (diesel and petrol) baseline. From one of the scenarios, biodiesel production from waste cooking oil and bioethanol from sugarbeet offer the biggest potential for emissions savings relative to fossil fuel equivalent and offering a maximum emission savings of 4.1% observed with a biofuel market share of 10% reached in 2020. It was also established that under current biofuel feedstock mix, to achieve the 6% emissions saving primarily from biofuels as proposed in the LCTP, 23.8% of the transport fuels market would be required to be held by biofuels by 2020. &amp;copy; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulted database for embodiment intensity and sectoral embodiment of natural resources and environmental emissions is of essential implications in context of systems ecology and ecological economics in general and of global climate change in particular. &amp;copy; 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It can be applied by the cement industry for the selection of alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) and by authorities for decision-support regarding the permission of waste co-processing in cement kilns. In the field of sustainable construction, the model can be used to compare clinker production options. Two case studies are presented. First, co-processing of four different types of waste is analyzed at a modern precalciner kiln system. Second, clinker production is compared between five kiln systems. Results show that the use of waste (tires, prepared industrial waste, dried sewage sludge, blast furnace slag) led to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased resource consumption, and mostly to reduced aggregated environmental impacts. Regarding the different kiln systems, the environmental impact generally increased with decreasing energy efficiency.","collectionName":"Environmental Science and Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"clinker":27.410134243084197,"product":27.403628625650814,"kiln":21.930880358183263,"wast":21.92313036472877,"system":16.442069205177553,"cement":10.964053697233679,"cradle":10.962666253542935,"option":10.962203558341333,"cycle":10.962111006454416,"to":10.961972170593057,"assess":10.961872996219695,"consumpt":10.961798612212247,"emiss":10.961674632718415,"life":10.961656598697234,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"impact":10.961565182364385,"environment":10.961503059228558,"industri":10.961458997900085,"precalcin":5.482720089545816,"judgment":5.482720089545816,"tire":5.482720089545816,"permiss":5.482720089545816,"afr":5.482720089545816,"decis":5.482720089545816,"sewag":5.482026848616839,"sludg":5.482026848616839,"slag":5.482026848616839,"furnac":5.482026848616839,"blast":5.482026848616839,"technology":5.482026848616839,"construct":5.481680047850402,"expert":5.481471909645883,"depend":5.481333126771467,"line":5.4812339843533024,"lca":5.481101779170666,"greenhous":5.481055503227208,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"ga":5.4808839913495895,"input":5.480870378035768,"materi":5.480799166912561,"fuel":5.480793232423387,"energi":5.480751529614279}},{"id":"ea177fc6-9a9b-3e5c-8bc7-e588cc05831e","title":"Quantifying the total environmental impacts of an industrial symbiosis-a comparison of process-, hybrid and input-output life cycle assessment","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/quantifying-total-environmental-impacts-industrial-symbiosisa-comparison-process-hybrid-inputoutput/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/quantifying-total-environmental-impacts-industrial-symbiosisa-comparison-process-hybrid-inputoutput/","creator":"Tuomas J.

Local co-operation in industrial symbioses can reduce raw material use and waste disposal, but material and energy flows extending outside symbiosis boundaries can cause considerable environmental impacts. These external impacts are often ignored in industrial symbiosis studies. In this study, we compared process, hybrid and input-output life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in quantifying the overall environmental impacts of a forest industrial symbiosis, situated in Kymenlaakso, Finland. Conclusions from an earlier process-LCA were strengthened by the use of hybrid-LCA as local emissions were found to cause less than half of the global impacts. In some impact categories, the whole impact was caused by supply chain emissions (land use, metal depletion and ozone depletion). The cutoff in process-LCA was found to be less than 25%, except in metal depletion and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Input-output LCA approximated hybrid-LCA results well in most impact categories, but seriously underestimated land use and overestimated terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the results we conclude, that input-output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.","collectionName":"Environmental Science and Technology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"impact":49.32704332063973,"lca":38.36771245419467,"industri":38.3651064926503,"symbiosi":27.4042909877263,"output":21.92493593741321,"input":21.923481512143074,"environment":16.442254588842836,"hybrid":10.965440179091631,"depletion":10.964053697233679,"ecotox":10.964053697233679,"metal":10.963360095700803,"land":10.962666253542935,"cycle":10.962111006454416,"assess":10.961872996219695,"categori":10.961798612212247,"emiss":10.961674632718415,"life":10.961656598697234,"materi":10.961598333825123,"ozon":5.482720089545816,"symbiosis":5.482720089545816,"aggreg":5.482720089545816,"cutoff":5.482720089545816,"kymenlaakso":5.482720089545816,"deplet":5.482720089545816,"alloc":5.482026848616839,"interpret":5.482026848616839,"finland":5.482026848616839,"dispos":5.482026848616839,"symbios":5.482026848616839,"byproduct":5.482026848616839,"forest":5.481680047850402,"comparison":5.481471909645883,"boundari":5.481471909645883,"firm":5.481101779170666,"chain":5.481101779170666,"ecologi":5.481017639498762,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"flow":5.480936498109847,"oper":5.480870378035768,"co":5.48085819754526,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"order":5.480793232423387,"wast":5.480782591182193,"energi":5.480751529614279}},{"id":"960ee910-fe1a-3216-aebb-bd3342004cf5","title":"Improving the CO2 performance of cement, part III: the relevance of industrial symbiosis and how to measure its impact","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/improving-co2-performance-cement-part-iii-relevance-industrial-symbiosis-measure-impact/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/improving-co2-performance-cement-part-iii-relevance-industrial-symbiosis-measure-impact/","creator":"Jonas Ammenberg, Leenard Baas, Mats Eklund, Roozbeh Feiz, Anton Helgstrand, Richard Marshall","description":"Cement production contributes to extensive CO2 emissions. However, the climate impact can vary significantly between different production systems and different types of cement products. The market is dominated by ordinary Portland cement, which is based on primary raw materials and commonly associated with combustion of vast amounts of fossil fuels. Therefore, the production of Portland cement can be described as a rather linear process. But there are alternative options, for example, involving large amounts of industrial byproducts and renewable energy which are more cyclic and thus can be characterized as relatively \"synergistic\". The main purpose of this article is to study how relevant the leading ideas of industrial symbiosis are for the cement industry based on a quantitative comparison of the CO2 emissions from different cement production systems and products, both existing and hypothetical. This has been done by studying a group of three cement plants in Germany, denoted as Cluster West, and the production of cement clinker and three selected cement products. Based on this analysis and literature, it is discussed to what extent industrial symbiosis options can lead to reduced CO2 emissions, for Cluster West and the cement industry in general. Utilizing a simplified LCA model (\"cradle to gate\"), it was shown that the CO2 emissions from Cluster West declined by 45% over the period 1997-2009, per tonne of average cement. This was mainly due to a large share of blended cement, i.e., incorporation of byproducts from local industries as supplementary cementitious materials. For producers of Portland cement to radically reduce the climate impact it is necessary to engage with new actors and find fruitful cooperation regarding byproducts, renewable energy and waste heat. Such a development is very much in line with the key ideas of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, meaning that it appears highly relevant for the cement industry to move further in this direction. From a climate perspective, it is essential that actors influencing the cement market acknowledge the big difference between different types of cement, where an enlarged share of blended cement products (substituting clinker with byproducts such as slag and fly ash) offers a great scope for future reduction of CO2 emissions. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the concepts of exergy analysis and the linkages between exergy and environmental impact are discussed, and several issues regarding the exergies of waste emissions are addressed. Exergy is a measure of the degree of disequilibrium between a substance and its environment. The relations between several measures of environmental impact potential and exergy are investigated by comparing current methods used to assess the environmental impact potential of waste emissions and the exergy associated with those emissions. A case study is presented, to highlight the information revealed using exergy, in which the measures of environmental impact potential considered are the Ontario Ministry of Environment's schedule of industrial air emission limits, and two methods of assessing the environmental costs for air emissions resulting from the combustion of three common fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas.","collectionName":"International Journal of Energy Research","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1999","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"exergi":54.81680047850402,"environment":43.846012236914234,"emiss":32.88502389815525,"impact":32.88469554709316,"wast":16.44234777354658,"air":10.963360095700803,"industri":10.961458997900085,"environ":10.961419084634679,"signfic":5.482720089545816,"ectiv":5.482720089545816,"ministri":5.482720089545816,"ontario":5.482720089545816,"disequilibrium":5.482720089545816,"schule":5.481680047850402,"substanc":5.481680047850402,"or":5.481680047850402,"linkag":5.481471909645883,"zero":5.481471909645883,"relat":5.481159621088721,"coal":5.481159621088721,"combust":5.481159621088721,"oil":5.481017639498762,"assess":5.480936498109847,"attent":5.480936498109847,"tool":5.480916662546665,"ga":5.4808839913495895,"cost":5.480828299348617,"fossil":5.480793232423387,"fuel":5.480793232423387,"energi":5.480751529614279,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"14aed560-40ec-3161-a0a3-5622100b8323","title":"Evaluation of innovative municipal solid waste management through urban symbiosis: A case study of Kawasaki","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluation-innovative-municipal-solid-waste-management-through-urban-symbiosis-case-study-kawasaki-1/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/evaluation-innovative-municipal-solid-waste-management-through-urban-symbiosis-case-study-kawasaki-1/","creator":"Yong Geng, Fujita Tsuyoshi, Xudong Chen","description":"Industrial symbiosis encourages the establishment of a broad eco-industrial network so that more synergy opportunities can be identified. By linking municipal solid waste management (MSWM) with local industries, i.e., urban symbiosis, new symbiotic opportunities can be generated from the geographic proximity of urban and industrial areas, transferring physical resources from urban refuse directly to industrial applications and improving the overall eco-efficiency of the city as a whole. Using a case study of Kawasaki, this paper simulates and evaluates an innovative waste management initiative in Kawasaki by an scenario simulation model based on the LCA approach. Results show that recycling mixed paper, mixed plastics, and organic wastes and utilizing the recycled materials in industrial production will potentially reduce about 69 kt CO2(e) emissions and 8 kt incineration ashes to be landfilled in 2015. To achieve these outcomes, the total additional cost compared with the current practice is about 1.2 billion JPY. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Journal of Cleaner Production","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"industri":32.88437699370026,"wast":21.92313036472877,"kawasaki":16.446080545850517,"symbiosi":16.44257459263578,"manag":16.44237969727016,"kt":10.965440179091631,"eco":10.961918769618485,"opportun":10.961872996219695,"jpy":5.482720089545816,"establish":5.482720089545816,"mswm":5.482026848616839,"proxim":5.482026848616839,"synergi":5.482026848616839,"plastic":5.482026848616839,"ash":5.482026848616839,"inciner":5.481680047850402,"citi":5.481680047850402,"billion":5.481333126771467,"initi":5.481101779170666,"lca":5.481101779170666,"simul":5.480936498109847,"network":5.480936498109847,"practic":5.480916662546665,"effici":5.4808839913495895,"co":5.48085819754526,"emiss":5.4808373163592075,"cost":5.480828299348617,"resourc":5.480799166912561,"materi":5.480799166912561,"product":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"0f90f19c-3388-33f7-88ca-23aa66daca6b","title":"Life cycle assessment of electricity generation using fast pyrolysis bio-oil","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/life-cycle-assessment-electricity-generation-using-fast-pyrolysis-biooil-2/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/life-cycle-assessment-electricity-generation-using-fast-pyrolysis-biooil-2/","creator":"Jiqing Fan, Tom N.

This paper investigated the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for energy generated from forest resources through pyrolysis-based processing. The GHG emissions of producing pyrolysis bio-oil (pyrolysis oil) from different forest resources were first investigated; logging residues collected from natural regeneration mixed hardwood stands, hybrid poplar cultivated and harvested from abandoned agricultural lands, short rotation forestry (SRF) willow plantations and waste wood available at the site of the pyrolysis plant. Effects of biomass transportation were investigated through a range of distances to a central pyrolysis facility through road transport by semi-truck. Pyrolysis oil is assumed to be converted to electrical power through co-combustion in conventional fossil fuels power plants, gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) and diesel generators. Life cycle GHG emissions were compared with power generated using fossil fuels and power generated using biomass direct combustion in a conventional Rankine power plant. Life cycle GHG savings of 77%-99% were estimated for power generation from pyrolysis oil combustion relative to fossil fuels combustion, depending on the biomass feedstock and combustion technologies used. Several scenario analyses were conducted to determine effects of pyrolysis oil transportation distance, N-fertilizer inputs to energy crop plantations, and assumed electricity mixes for pyrolysis oil production. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","collectionName":"Renewable Energy","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode"},"index":4,"keywords":{"pyrolysi":49.338241637551555,"oil":38.36712347649134,"power":32.88610583699257,"combust":27.405798105443605,"biomass":21.926720191401607,"ghg":21.92493593741321,"cycle":21.92422201290883,"plant":16.443701953059907,"transport":16.44347886326616,"electr":16.443166509681625,"emiss":16.442511949077623,"life":16.44248489804585,"fuel":16.44237969727016,"fossil":16.44237969727016,"energi":16.442254588842836,"plantat":10.965440179091631,"forest":10.963360095700803,"bio":10.963360095700803,"distanc":10.962943819291766,"ga":10.961767982699179,"resourc":10.961598333825123,"srf":5.482720089545816,"willow":5.482720089545816,"semi":5.482720089545816,"crop":5.482720089545816,"wood":5.482720089545816,"turbin":5.482720089545816,"hardwood":5.482720089545816,"lead":5.482720089545816,"poplar":5.482720089545816,"portfolio":5.482720089545816,"rankin":5.482720089545816,"gtcc":5.482720089545816,"regener":5.482026848616839,"road":5.482026848616839,"diesel":5.482026848616839,"forestri":5.482026848616839,"truck":5.482026848616839,"facil":5.481680047850402,"residu":5.481680047850402,"site":5.481680047850402,"rotat":5.481680047850402,"festock":5.481471909645883,"mix":5.481471909645883,"save":5.481471909645883,"fertil":5.481471909645883,"standard":5.481333126771467,"land":5.481333126771467,"greenhous":5.481055503227208,"assess":5.480936498109847,"input":5.480870378035768,"co":5.48085819754526,"wast":5.480782591182193,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"product":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"fbeb4a45-2d68-3d60-b3b9-cda4ec507ea4","title":"Global and regional drivers of accelerating CO2 emissions.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/global-regional-drivers-accelerating-co2-emissions/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/global-regional-drivers-accelerating-co2-emissions/","creator":"Michael R Raupach, Gregg Marland, Philippe Ciais, Corinne Le Qu&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;, Josep G Canadell, Gernot Klepper, Christopher B Field","description":"CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel burning and industrial processes have been accelerating at a global scale, with their growth rate increasing from 1.1% y(-1) for 1990-1999 to &amp;gt;3% y(-1) for 2000-2004. The emissions growth rate since 2000 was greater than for the most fossil-fuel intensive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenarios developed in the late 1990s. Global emissions growth since 2000 was driven by a cessation or reversal of earlier declining trends in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (energy/GDP) and the carbon intensity of energy (emissions/energy), coupled with continuing increases in population and per-capita GDP. Nearly constant or slightly increasing trends in the carbon intensity of energy have been recently observed in both developed and developing regions. No region is decarbonizing its energy supply. The growth rate in emissions is strongest in rapidly developing economies, particularly China. Together, the developing and least-developed economies (forming 80% of the world's population) accounted for 73% of global emissions growth in 2004 but only 41% of global emissions and only 23% of global cumulative emissions since the mid-18th century.

Papageorgiou, J. R. Barton, A. Karagiannidis","description":"Waste management activities contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions approximately by 4%. In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions. &amp;copy; 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this trend is changing with the exponential growth of information and communications technologies (ICT), giving many Sub-Sahara African women access to computers, the Internet, and other related technologies. Based on the work of a four-member research team from Kenya and the United States, this article examines the integration of female college students into the formal ICT work sector in Kenya. We do so by examining major bottlenecks and enablers to such integration from historical and contemporary perspectives. Using an interpretive approach, we conducted 32 interviews with women in an ICT program offered by a university in Kenya. Our findings indicate that women were highly optimistic, embracing ICT as a practical mechanism for achieving entry into the labor market. However, they perceived significant structural barriers, such as public policies that failed to facilitate the development of the ICT sector, gender discrimination by employers, and training that provided them with insufficient technical skills to enable them to effectively perform in the workplace. These findings largely confirm the gendered perspectives found in similar studies conducted in other countries. However, what appear as global perspectives are informed by the local causes.","collectionName":"The Information Society","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"ict":27.413600447729078,"woman":27.403547711586697,"kenya":21.930880358183263,"perspectif":16.445040143551203,"sub":10.965440179091631,"integr":10.962035278997524,"technologi":10.961476249541146,"work":10.961458997900085,"enabl":5.482720089545816,"saharan":5.482720089545816,"subsist":5.482720089545816,"farmer":5.482720089545816,"bottleneck":5.482720089545816,"sahara":5.482720089545816,"housewif":5.482720089545816,"era":5.482026848616839,"internet":5.481680047850402,"entri":5.481471909645883,"interview":5.481471909645883,"barrier":5.481333126771467,"discrimin":5.481333126771467,"access":5.4812339843533024,"it":5.4812339843533024,"skill":5.4812339843533024,"univers":5.481159621088721,"workplac":5.481101779170666,"colleg":5.481101779170666,"train":5.481101779170666,"student":5.481101779170666,"program":5.481055503227208,"labor":5.481017639498762,"educ":5.480986085296529,"opportun":5.480936498109847,"team":5.480936498109847,"employ":5.480936498109847,"trend":5.480916662546665,"growth":5.4808993061061235,"commun":5.480870378035768,"region":5.48084723497695,"market":5.4808373163592075,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"workforc":5.480799166912561,"economi":5.480793232423387,"comput":5.480787721794762,"role":5.480761464853082,"gender":5.480754657385289,"develop":5.480740544194678,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"5a28b138-15fb-3733-a8d8-bfe427fb7c63","title":"Women in the workforce and family structure in Australia","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/women-workforce-family-structure-australia/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/women-workforce-family-structure-australia/","creator":"Anne Daly","description":"The purpose of this paper is to set out some of the changes that have taken place in the economic status of women in Australia and to discuss the relationship between economic factors and family structure.

The factors are categorized into social factors (family, peers, and media), structural factors (computer use, teacher/counselor influence, same sex versus coeducational schools), and individual differences. The impact of culture on these various factors is also explored.\n\nFindings \n– The model indicates that parents, particularly fathers, are the key influencers of girls' choice of IT careers. Teachers and counselors provide little or no career direction. Hypotheses propose that early access to computers may reduce intimidation with technology and that same‐sex education may serve to reduce career bias against IT.\n\nResearch limitations/implications \n– While the model is multidisciplinary, much of research from which it draws is five to eight years old. Patterns of career choices, availability of technology, increased independence of women and girls, offshore/nearshore outsourcings of IT jobs are just some of the factors that may be insufficiently addressed in this study.\n\nPractical implications \n– A “Recommendations” section provides some practical steps to increase the involvement of girls in IT‐related careers and activities at an early age. The article identifies cultural research as a limitation and ways to address this.\n\nOriginality/value \n– The paper is an assimilation of literature from diverse fields and provides a testable model for research on gender and IT.","collectionName":"Information Technology & People","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"it":43.84987187482642,"career":43.84696302428615,"girl":32.896320537274896,"choic":27.406169921766512,"technologi":21.922952499082292,"influenc":16.442958255889586,"comput":16.442363165384286,"assimil":10.965440179091631,"counselor":10.965440179091631,"testabl":10.965440179091631,"sex":10.963360095700803,"educ":10.961972170593057,"workforc":10.961598333825123,"woman":10.961419084634679,"nearshor":5.482720089545816,"intimid":5.482720089545816,"independ":5.482720089545816,"multidisciplinari":5.482720089545816,"recommendats":5.482720089545816,"outsourcing":5.482720089545816,"coucat":5.482720089545816,"schools":5.482720089545816,"sociologi":5.482720089545816,"section":5.482026848616839,"mia":5.482026848616839,"teacher":5.482026848616839,"involv":5.482026848616839,"parent":5.482026848616839,"determin":5.482026848616839,"father":5.481680047850402,"peer":5.481680047850402,"cultur":5.481471909645883,"avail":5.481471909645883,"bia":5.481471909645883,"psychologi":5.481471909645883,"access":5.4812339843533024,"direct":5.4812339843533024,"busi":5.481017639498762,"scienc":5.481017639498762,"job":5.4808993061061235,"increas":5.480870378035768,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"social":5.4808373163592075,"impact":5.480782591182193,"gender":5.480754657385289,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"071adc68-c637-3ada-a07d-d4a7a1033799","title":"Revisting Career Path Assumptions: The Case of Women in the IT Workforce","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/revisting-career-path-assumptions-case-women-it-workforce/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/revisting-career-path-assumptions-case-women-it-workforce/","creator":"Jeria Quesenberry, Eileen M Trauth","description":"Many researchers have argued that additional systematic analysis of the information technology (IT) workforce is necessary in order to more deeply understand organizational human behavior as it relates to career anchors or values and motivations that attract an individual to a particular career.

The findings suggested that the effects of parenthood on workforce participation were different for men and women. For women, parenthood was associated with decreasing participation in paid employment and fewer hours worked. For men, however, parenthood was not associated with decreased workforce participation and in some cases was associated with increased working hours. These findings had consequences for personal income, with 83-90 % of the total gender income gap in this cohort being attributed to gender differences in the effects of parenthood. These findings suggest that parenthood has markedly different effects on workforce participation and income for men and women.","collectionName":"Journal of Family and Economic Issues","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2013"},"index":4,"keywords":{"parenthood":38.37904062682071,"workforc":27.403995834562807,"man":27.403742832268865,"woman":27.403547711586697,"incom":21.924638484354883,"hour":10.964053697233679,"cohort":10.963360095700803,"gender":10.961509314770579,"christchurch":5.482720089545816,"zealand":5.482720089545816,"birth":5.481680047850402,"individu":5.481055503227208,"consequ":5.481055503227208,"health":5.481017639498762,"employ":5.480936498109847,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"develop":5.480740544194678}},{"id":"b683e244-ce19-3d40-89c2-bdc86fa99911","title":"Retaining women in the U.S. IT workforce: theorizing the influence of organizational factors","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/retaining-women-it-workforce-theorizing-influence-organizational-factors/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/retaining-women-it-workforce-theorizing-influence-organizational-factors/","creator":"Eileen M Trauth, Jeria L Quesenberry, Haiyan Huang","description":"The challenge of meeting the demand for information technology (IT) workers is addressed by examining three important organizational factors that affect women’s retention in the IT field. Much of the research on gender and IT assumes a unilateral effect: all organizational factors affect all women in the same ways. An alternative view that is explored in this research is that within gender differences offer rich insights into the gender imbalance in the IT profession. The individual differences theory of gender and IT enabled us to examine variation in organizational influences on women through analysis of transcripts from in-depth interviews conducted with 92 women in the IT workforce in the U.S.A. The results show that three organizational factors – work–life balance, organizational climate, and mentoring – affected the women’s career development in a range of ways. Our findings shed new light on what has been interpreted by other researchers as contradictory findings because our theoretical starting point is the assumption that women are not all the same, that within-gender variation is expected and that it provides an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of gender relations in the IT field. Using this theory we were able to identify opportunities for the development of interventions by linking the themes embedded in the three workplace factors to the constructs of the theory. The individual identity construct revealed the ways in which a woman’s demographic and professional characteristics affect her career choices. The individual influences construct focused attention on the ways in which differences in personality, abilities, and influential people shape one’s career. Finally, the environmental influences construct characterized contextual influences on women’s participation in the IT profession. Our findings show that both research and interventions directed at increasing the retention of women must be flexible enough to respond to the variation that exists among women and within IT workplaces.","collectionName":"European Journal of Information Systems","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2009"},"index":4,"keywords":{"it":54.812339843533024,"woman":43.845676338538716,"influenc":27.404930426482643,"gender":27.403773286926448,"women":16.44347886326616,"variat":16.443305337512,"career":16.442611134107306,"retent":10.965440179091631,"profess":10.962943819291766,"intervent":10.962666253542935,"workplac":10.962203558341333,"opportun":10.961872996219695,"workforc":10.961598333825123,"develop":10.961481088389355,"transcript":5.482720089545816,"imbal":5.482026848616839,"theme":5.482026848616839,"ident":5.481680047850402,"gend":5.481680047850402,"interview":5.481471909645883,"one":5.481471909645883,"lif":5.481471909645883,"light":5.481471909645883,"shape":5.481333126771467,"choic":5.4812339843533024,"balanc":5.481159621088721,"relat":5.481159621088721,"offer":5.481101779170666,"worker":5.481055503227208,"contextu":5.481055503227208,"climat":5.480936498109847,"attent":5.480936498109847,"demand":5.480936498109847,"abil":5.48084723497695,"environment":5.480751529614279,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"work":5.480729498950042,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"bdbc6cdc-043f-35a9-ba63-c3b89c6b2fe3","title":"Women in the UK academic medicine workforce","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-uk-academic-medicine-workforce/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-uk-academic-medicine-workforce/","creator":"Bhupinder Sandhu, Ceri Margerison, Anita Holdcroft","description":"OBJECTIVES: \nThis study aimed to compare data on the employment profiles (such as grade, place of work, etc.) of male and female clinical academics. \nMETHODS: \nWe carried out a comparative review of workforce data within academic medicine for 2004 and 2005, pertaining to the workforce in all specialties in UK medical schools. \nRESULTS: \nWe identified 3255 and 3365 lecturers, senior lecturers, readers and professors in 2004 and 2005, respectively, of whom 21% were women.

The purpose of this paper is to explore a particular instance of how ubiquitous computing is utilized to maintain work-life balance from the perspectives of women in the information technology workforce.","collectionName":"Designing Ubiquitous Information Environments: Socio-Technical Issues and Challenges","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"balanc":27.405798105443605,"work":27.40364749475021,"lif":21.925887638583532,"technologi":16.442214374311718,"woman":16.44212862695202,"perspectif":10.963360095700803,"life":10.961656598697234,"workforc":10.961598333825123,"role":10.961522929706163,"inform":10.961444506406592,"transform":5.481471909645883,"shift":5.481159621088721,"natur":5.481017639498762,"home":5.481017639498762,"demand":5.480936498109847,"man":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"89b6c5a9-c323-320d-89ae-bd06a923141d","title":"Lifting the barriers?

This article draws on material from seven case studies in the National Health Service in England to understand the conditions under which workplace education and training has the most potential to facilitate women's job progression. It illustrates how workforce crises at a local level prompted workforce managers to create different career pathways to areas of workforce shortage while line managers encouraged women's participation along these pathways through workplace education and training. Certain aspects of the government's workforce modernization agenda facilitate these activities but it is the presence of enthusiastic local actors at four points (corporate, workforce development managers, line management and external) that drives and manages these activities. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","collectionName":"Gender, Work and Organization","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"workplac":27.40550889585333,"workforc":27.403995834562807,"train":21.924407116682666,"educ":21.923944341186115,"manag":21.923172929693546,"woman":21.922838169269358,"pathwai":10.963360095700803,"line":10.962467968706605,"progress":10.962035278997524,"job":10.961798612212247,"activ":10.961674632718415,"external":5.482720089545816,"blackwel":5.482720089545816,"cri":5.482720089545816,"agenda":5.482026848616839,"modern":5.482026848616839,"qualif":5.482026848616839,"shortag":5.482026848616839,"corpor":5.481680047850402,"england":5.481680047850402,"drive":5.481680047850402,"barrier":5.481333126771467,"govern":5.481333126771467,"access":5.4812339843533024,"advanc":5.481159621088721,"nation":5.481055503227208,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"health":5.481017639498762,"condition":5.480986085296529,"career":5.480870378035768,"increas":5.480870378035768,"servic":5.4808373163592075,"materi":5.480799166912561,"develop":5.480740544194678}},{"id":"9436cb92-4aa1-3e3d-af99-bfaa3961d7aa","title":"The (dis)placement of women in the IT workforce: An investigation of individual career values and organisational interventions","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/displacement-women-it-workforce-investigation-individual-career-values-organisational-interventions/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/displacement-women-it-workforce-investigation-individual-career-values-organisational-interventions/","creator":"Jeria L.

Our theoretical lens, the individual differences theory of gender and IT, enabled us to look more critically at how the effects of interventions are embedded in the range of women's career anchors that takes within-gender variation into account. The analysis demonstrates that organisational interventions must be flexible enough to account for the diversity and variation among women. Further, the analysis shows that it is necessary to move away from ‘one size fits all’ organisational interventions that often reflect stereotypes about women in the IT workforce.","collectionName":"Information Systems Journal","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012"},"index":4,"keywords":{"woman":32.88425725390404,"it":27.406169921766512,"intervent":21.92533250708587,"career":21.923481512143074,"organis":16.448160268637448,"workforc":16.442397500737684,"gend":10.963360095700803,"anchor":10.962943819291766,"variat":10.962203558341333,"plac":5.482720089545816,"dis":5.482720089545816,"stereotyp":5.481680047850402,"divers":5.481680047850402,"len":5.481680047850402,"profess":5.481471909645883,"one":5.481471909645883,"move":5.481017639498762,"gender":5.480754657385289,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"inform":5.480722253203296}},{"id":"dc521b19-ce3c-3080-8fcb-bb8e32c164a6","title":"Career Aspirations of Women in the 20th Century","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/career-aspirations-women-20th-century/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/career-aspirations-women-20th-century/","creator":"Desirae M Domenico, Karen H Jones","description":"Women have increasingly become more involved in the workforce following World War II.

No empirically based analysis of the causes and implications of this aging workforce exists. \nOBJECTIVES: \nTo identify and assess key sources of changes in the age distribution and total supply of RNs and to project the future age distribution and total RN workforce up to the year 2020. \nDESIGN AND SETTING: \nRetrospective cohort analysis of employment trends of recent RN cohorts over their lifetimes based on US Bureau of the Census Current Population Surveys between 1973 and 1998. Recent workforce trends were used to forecast long-term age and employment of RNs. \nPARTICIPANTS: \nEmployed RNs aged 23 to 64 years (N = 60,386). \nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: \nAnnual full-time equivalent employment of RNs in total and by single year of age. \nRESULTS: \nThe average age of working RNs increased by 4.5 years between 1983 and 1998. The number of full-time equivalent RNs observed in recent cohorts has been approximately 35% lower than that observed at similar ages for cohorts that entered the labor market 20 years earlier. Over the next 2 decades, this trend will lead to a further aging of the RN workforce because the largest cohorts of RNs will be between age 50 and 69 years. Within the next 10 years, the average age of RNs is forecast to be 45.4 years, an increase of 3.5 years over the current age, with more than 40% of the RN workforce expected to be older than 50 years. The total number of full-time equivalent RNs per capita is forecast to peak around the year 2007 and decline steadily thereafter as the largest cohorts of RNs retire. By the year 2020, the RN workforce is forecast to be roughly the same size as it is today, declining nearly 20% below projected RN workforce requirements. \nCONCLUSIONS: \nThe primary factor that has led to the aging of the RN workforce appears to be the decline in younger women choosing nursing as a career during the last 2 decades. Unless this trend is reversed, the RN workforce will continue to age, and eventually shrink, and will not meet projected long-term workforce requirements.

Making Technology Masculine: Men, Women, and Modern Machines in America, 1870-1945 maps the historical process through which men laid claims to technology as their exclusive terrain. It also explores how women contested this ascendancy of the male discourse and engineered alternative plots. From the moral gymnasium of the shop floor to the staging grounds of World's Fairs, engineers, inventors, social scientists, activists, and novelists emplotted and questioned technology as our modern male myth. Oldenziel recounts the history of technology - both as intellectual construct and material practice - by analyzing these struggles. Drawing on a broad range of sources, she explains why male machines rather than female fabrics have become the modern markers of technology. She shows how technology developed as a narrative production of modern manliness, allowing women little room for negotiation.","collectionName":"Technology and Culture","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2000"},"index":4,"keywords":{"technologi":43.845904998164585,"woman":21.922838169269358,"man":16.44224569936132,"claim":10.965440179091631,"modern":10.964053697233679,"histori":10.964053697233679,"america":10.962943819291766,"ascend":5.482720089545816,"activist":5.482720089545816,"narr":5.482720089545816,"fabric":5.482720089545816,"manli":5.482720089545816,"plot":5.482720089545816,"gymnasium":5.482720089545816,"shop":5.482720089545816,"oldenziel":5.482720089545816,"surpris":5.482720089545816,"strike":5.482720089545816,"fair":5.482720089545816,"inventor":5.482720089545816,"novelist":5.482720089545816,"myth":5.482026848616839,"note":5.482026848616839,"ground":5.481680047850402,"scientist":5.481680047850402,"engin":5.481680047850402,"discours":5.481680047850402,"terrain":5.481471909645883,"room":5.481333126771467,"floor":5.4812339843533024,"marker":5.481159621088721,"map":5.481159621088721,"negoti":5.481159621088721,"machin":5.481017639498762,"practic":5.480916662546665,"social":5.4808373163592075,"materi":5.480799166912561,"world":5.480727571894862,"product":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"a0dc7f3c-2101-3469-b03f-fa45675947a5","title":"Women and Salary Negotiation: The Costs of Self-Advocacy","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-salary-negotiation-costs-selfadvocacy/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-salary-negotiation-costs-selfadvocacy/","creator":"Mary E.

The ways in which the results fit with contemporary theorizing about sexism and with the shifting standards model (Biernat, 1995, 2003) are discussed.","collectionName":"Journal of Applied Social Psychology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008"},"index":4,"keywords":{"job":21.923597224424494,"woman":16.44212862695202,"segreg":10.965440179091631,"salari":10.961872996219695,"gender":10.961509314770579,"man":10.961497132907546,"work":10.961458997900085,"between":5.482720089545816,"devalu":5.482720089545816,"biernat":5.482720089545816,"sexism":5.482720089545816,"duti":5.482720089545816,"alloc":5.482026848616839,"differenti":5.481471909645883,"discrimin":5.481333126771467,"standard":5.481333126771467,"subject":5.481101779170666,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"wage":5.4808200663548945,"workforc":5.480799166912561}},{"id":"7ce000b8-85e2-322c-bc9c-f64c30b9911e","title":"Salaries, salary growth, and promotions of men and women in a large, private firm","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/salaries-salary-growth-promotions-men-women-large-private-firm/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/salaries-salary-growth-promotions-men-women-large-private-firm/","creator":"BA Gerhart, GT Milkovich","description":"[Excerpt] Salaries, promotions, and salary growth of men and women in a large, diversified firm were examined for the years 1980 through 1986. Consistent with other studies, men's average salary was higher than women's average salary. However, statistical adjustment for gender differences in education, tenure, time at level, experience, and job level substantially reduced the salary advantage of men over women. Although the average salary of men was higher than that of women in 1980 and 1986, women actually received greater numbers of promotions, as well as larger percentage salary increases between 1980 and 1986. One reason for women's salary growth advantage was the higher average performance ratings of women between 1980 and 1986. One important reason for women's promotion advantage was their greater likelihood of being in (lower) job levels where promotion opportunities were greatest.","collectionName":"Pay equity: Empirical inquiries","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1989"},"index":4,"keywords":{"salari":54.809364981098476,"woman":49.32638588085606,"promotion":27.40527751613604,"man":27.403742832268865,"growth":16.44269791831837,"firm":10.962203558341333,"job":10.961798612212247,"lower":5.482720089545816,"excerpt":5.482720089545816,"tenur":5.482720089545816,"adjust":5.482026848616839,"likelihood":5.482026848616839,"percentag":5.482026848616839,"increa":5.481055503227208,"educ":5.480986085296529,"opportun":5.480936498109847,"perform":5.4807778025867115,"time":5.480757963875433,"gender":5.480754657385289,"experi":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"343d8a7c-8677-306a-96d6-5e5b3075d2e9","title":"Do Women Avoid Salary Negotiations?

By using a natural field experiment that randomizes nearly 2,500 job-seekers into jobs that vary important details of the labor contract, we are able to observe both the nature of sorting and the extent of salary negotiations. We observe interesting data patterns. For example, we find that when there is no explicit statement that wages are negotiable, men are more likely to negotiate than women. However, when we explicitly mention the possibility that wages are negotiable, this difference disappears, and even tends to reverse. In terms of sorting, we find that men in contrast to women prefer job environments where the ‘rules of wage determination’ are ambiguous. This leads to the gender gap being much more pronounced in jobs that leave negotiation of wage ambiguous.","collectionName":"Quarterly Journal of Economics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012"},"index":4,"keywords":{"negoti":21.924638484354883,"job":21.923597224424494,"wage":21.923280265419578,"woman":21.922838169269358,"salari":16.44280949432954,"natur":10.962035278997524,"labor":10.962035278997524,"gender":10.961509314770579,"experi":10.961497132907546,"man":10.961497132907546,"determinat":5.482720089545816,"statem":5.482720089545816,"contract":5.482720089545816,"randomiz":5.482720089545816,"possibl":5.481471909645883,"rule":5.481471909645883,"contrast":5.481159621088721,"extent":5.480986085296529,"market":5.4808373163592075,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"ee82c368-07e7-36f4-b432-c5f9929a2ce2","title":"Men, women, and money: Exploring the role of gender, gender-linkage of college major and career-information sources in salary expectations","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/men-women-money-exploring-role-gender-genderlinkage-college-major-careerinformation-sources-salary-e/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/men-women-money-exploring-role-gender-genderlinkage-college-major-careerinformation-sources-salary-e/","creator":"Kenneth E.

Based on suggestions by Marlin (1989) and social comparison theory, we examined the role that sources of career information (e.g.,professors, family) play in shaping college students' salary expectations. Results suggest: (1) differences in entry level salary expectations were associated with gender-linkage of college major and differences in peak salary expectations were associated with gender and gender-linkage of college major, (2) women gathered more information from female sources than did men, and men gathered more information from male sources than did women, and (3) career information was not predictive of either entry or peak salary expectations.","collectionName":"Sex Roles","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1996"},"index":4,"keywords":{"expect":49.33110585917972,"salari":38.36655548676893,"gender":32.884527944311735,"inform":27.40361126601648,"colleg":21.924407116682666,"career":21.923481512143074,"peak":16.445040143551203,"linkag":16.44441572893765,"entri":16.44441572893765,"man":16.44224569936132,"woman":16.44212862695202,"role":10.961522929706163,"marlin":5.482720089545816,"standards":5.482720089545816,"facet":5.482026848616839,"family":5.482026848616839,"suggest":5.481680047850402,"monei":5.481680047850402,"professor":5.481471909645883,"comparison":5.481471909645883,"student":5.481101779170666,"relatship":5.4808839913495895,"social":5.4808373163592075,"work":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"105f86de-ad8d-380a-9ea3-fd5b642da9b5","title":"Will the stork return to Europe and Japan?

We observe three distinct phases in women's status generated by the gradual increase in women's workforce opportunities. In the earliest phase, characteristic of the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, women earn low wages relative to men and are expected to shoulder all of the child care at home. As a result, most women specialize in home production and raising children. In an intermediate stage, women have improved (but not equal) labor market opportunities, but their household status lags. Women in this stage are still expected to do the majority of child care and household production. Increasing access to market work increases the opportunity cost of having children, and fertility falls. Female labor force participation increases. Working women in this phase of development have the strongest disincentives to having additional children since the entire burden of child care falls on them. In the final phase of development, women's labor market opportunities begin to equal those of men. In addition, the increased household bargaining power that comes from more equal wages results in much higher (if not gender-equal) male participation in household production. Female labor force participation is higher than in the intermediate phase. The increased participation of men in the household also reduces the disincentives for women to have additional children, and fertility rates rise compared to the intermediate phase. The intermediate, low-fertility phase might describe Japan, Italy, and Spain in the present day, while the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, and the modern-day United States may be entering the final phase. After presenting the empirical evidence, we predict that high-income countries with the lowest fertility rates are likely to see an increase in fertility in the coming decades.","collectionName":"The journal of economic perspectives : a journal of the American Economic Association","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008"},"index":4,"keywords":{"woman":54.807095423173394,"child":43.849276968709766,"fertil":38.37030336752118,"household":32.88695772653232,"care":21.92493593741321,"statu":21.92493593741321,"labor":21.924070557995048,"opportun":21.92374599243939,"product":21.92290290052065,"home":16.443052918496285,"market":16.442511949077623,"countri":16.442511949077623,"man":16.44224569936132,"disincentif":10.965440179091631,"equal":10.964053697233679,"japan":10.962943819291766,"stage":10.962666253542935,"increa":10.962111006454416,"forc":10.961918769618485,"increas":10.961740756071537,"wage":10.961640132709789,"workforc":10.961598333825123,"develop":10.961481088389355,"scandinavian":5.482720089545816,"stork":5.482720089545816,"burden":5.482720089545816,"if":5.482720089545816,"shoulder":5.482720089545816,"pha":5.482026848616839,"but":5.482026848616839,"netherland":5.482026848616839,"spain":5.481680047850402,"europ":5.481333126771467,"access":5.4812339843533024,"low":5.4812339843533024,"rise":5.481159621088721,"nation":5.481055503227208,"power":5.481017639498762,"cost":5.480828299348617,"interact":5.4807691231989555,"gender":5.480754657385289,"work":5.480729498950042,"present":5.4807239537404095}},{"id":"98aad57c-9302-310a-b42e-6c4d979b1989","title":"Negotiation for starting salary: Antecedents and outcomes among recent college graduates","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/negotiation-starting-salary-antecedents-outcomes-among-recent-college-graduates/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/negotiation-starting-salary-antecedents-outcomes-among-recent-college-graduates/","creator":"Patrick Gavan O'Shea, David F.

No gender differences were found regarding faculty participants' willingness to negotiate for increased salary; however, males were more likely to negotiate for promotion. Likewise, no gender differences were evident in practitioners' salary and promotion negotiation attempts, although none were expected, given the salary schedule constraints unique to occupations in the field of education. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to one profession, albeit both university faculty and school psychology practitioners, and was conducted in the USA, so the findings may have limited generalizability to other professions and/or in other countries. Practical implications: The paper demonstrates that gender pay differences exist despite no differences in males' and females' willingness to negotiate for salary. Consequently, it is likely that pay differences between men and women are due to reasons other than individuals' education levels, years in position, and negotiation practices. \nOriginality/value: \nThis is the first paper that tracks salaries and the negotiating practices of school psychologist trainers and practitioners. It also finds that male/female salary differences carry over into a female-dominated profession. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","collectionName":"Gender in Management: An International Journal","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"salari":54.809364981098476,"school":32.8888314578753,"practition":27.40840023925201,"profess":27.407359548229415,"psychologi":21.925887638583532,"negoti":21.924638484354883,"practic":21.92366665018666,"gender":21.923018629541158,"faculti":16.446080545850517,"promotion":16.443166509681625,"male":10.965440179091631,"psychologist":10.965440179091631,"willing":10.964053697233679,"femal":10.963360095700803,"univers":10.962319242177442,"educ":10.961972170593057,"trainer":5.482720089545816,"none":5.482720089545816,"satisfact":5.482720089545816,"generaliz":5.482720089545816,"emerald":5.482720089545816,"instructor":5.482720089545816,"attain":5.482026848616839,"colleagu":5.482026848616839,"usa":5.481680047850402,"schule":5.481680047850402,"member":5.481471909645883,"occup":5.481333126771467,"employe":5.4812339843533024,"constraint":5.4812339843533024,"individu":5.481055503227208,"job":5.4808993061061235,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"order":5.480793232423387,"man":5.480748566453773,"experi":5.480748566453773,"woman":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"c5eb5dd4-790f-3043-8859-b69135869f87","title":"Determinants and consequences of salary negotiations by male and female MBA graduates.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/determinants-consequences-salary-negotiations-male-female-mba-graduates/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/determinants-consequences-salary-negotiations-male-female-mba-graduates/","creator":"Barry Gerhart, Sara Rynes","description":"Although it has been suggested that women negotiate over salaries less frequently than men, there is little empirical evidence on this point.

In 2008, male physicians newly trained in New York State made on average $16,819 more than newly trained female physicians, compared to a $3,600 difference in 1999.","collectionName":"Health Affairs","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"physician":27.410134243084197,"salari":16.44280949432954,"gender":16.442263972155867,"york":10.964053697233679,"hour":10.964053697233679,"trend":10.96183332509333,"gap":10.961674632718415,"work":10.961458997900085,"woman":10.961419084634679,"resid":5.482720089545816,"specialti":5.482026848616839,"tendenc":5.481680047850402,"choic":5.4812339843533024,"care":5.4812339843533024,"program":5.481055503227208,"practic":5.480916662546665,"time":5.480757963875433,"man":5.480748566453773,"develop":5.480740544194678}},{"id":"f6be88cf-1f5c-33e2-be1e-6a7604123660","title":"Growth in Women’ s Relative Wages and Inequality Among Men: One Phenomenon or Two?","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/growth-women-s-relative-wages-inequality-among-men-one-phenomenon-two/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/growth-women-s-relative-wages-inequality-among-men-one-phenomenon-two/","creator":"Finis Welch","description":"In this article, the author examines a competing hypothesis to explain growth in women's relative wages.

They chronicle the progress made in education—where female college enrollment now exceeds that of males—and the workforce, where women have entered a wider variety of occupations and are staying on the job longer, even after becoming wives and mothers. But despite progress, lower-paying service and clerical positions remain predominantly female, and although the salary gap between men and women has shrunk, women are still paid less. As women continue to establish a greater presence outside the home, many have delayed marriage and motherhood. Marked jumps in divorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth have given rise to significant numbers of female-headed households. Married women who work contribute more significantly than ever to the financial well-being of their families, yet evidence shows that they continue to perform most household chores. Balancing Act focuses on how American women juggle the simultaneous demands of caregiving and wage earning, and compares their options to those of women in other countries. The United States is the only industrialized nation without policies to support working mothers and their families—most tellingly in the absence of subsidized childcare services. Many women are forced to work in less rewarding part-time or traditionally female jobs that allow easy exit and re-entry, and as a consequence poverty is the single greatest danger facing American women. As the authors show, the risk of poverty varies significantly by race and ethnicity, with African Americans—most of whose children live in mother-only families—the most adversely affected.","collectionName":"Canadian Journal of Urban Research","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1997"},"index":4,"keywords":{"woman":60.287804965490736,"mother":16.44441572893765,"act":16.443999380314402,"american":16.443999380314402,"motherhood":10.965440179091631,"poverti":10.965440179091631,"wife":10.965440179091631,"families":10.965440179091631,"marriag":10.965440179091631,"most":10.965440179091631,"household":10.962319242177442,"progress":10.962035278997524,"job":10.961798612212247,"servic":10.961674632718415,"work":10.961458997900085,"suzann":5.482720089545816,"wher":5.482720089545816,"ethnic":5.482720089545816,"enrol":5.482720089545816,"males":5.482720089545816,"americans":5.482720089545816,"bianchi":5.482720089545816,"chronicl":5.482720089545816,"breadwinn":5.482720089545816,"daphn":5.482720089545816,"jump":5.482720089545816,"divorc":5.482720089545816,"out":5.482720089545816,"wedlock":5.482720089545816,"childbirth":5.482720089545816,"re":5.482720089545816,"educat":5.482720089545816,"chore":5.482720089545816,"see":5.482026848616839,"absenc":5.481680047850402,"exit":5.481680047850402,"risk":5.481680047850402,"danger":5.481680047850402,"censu":5.481680047850402,"race":5.481680047850402,"spain":5.481680047850402,"th":5.481680047850402,"childcar":5.481680047850402,"famili":5.481471909645883,"entri":5.481471909645883,"occup":5.481333126771467,"of":5.4812339843533024,"rise":5.481159621088721,"child":5.481159621088721,"option":5.481101779170666,"colleg":5.481101779170666,"consequ":5.481055503227208,"nation":5.481055503227208,"varieti":5.481017639498762,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"home":5.481017639498762,"condition":5.480986085296529,"salari":5.480936498109847,"employ":5.480936498109847,"demand":5.480936498109847,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"wage":5.4808200663548945,"workforc":5.480799166912561,"role":5.480761464853082,"man":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"368753f1-cc6b-3af4-88f8-da31a7812f69","title":"Stereotype threat in salary negotiations is mediated by reservation salary","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/stereotype-threat-salary-negotiations-mediated-reservation-salary/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/stereotype-threat-salary-negotiations-mediated-reservation-salary/","creator":"Una Tellhed, Fredrik Björklund","description":"Women are stereotypically perceived as worse negotiators than men, which may make them ask for less salary than men when under stereotype threat (Kray et al., 2001). However, the mechanisms of stereotype threat are not yet properly understood. The current study investigated whether stereotype threat effects in salary negotiations can be explained by motivational factors. A total of 116 business students negotiated salary with a confederate and were either told that this was diagnostic of negotiating ability (threat manipulation) or not. Measures of minimum (reservation) and ideal (aspiration) salary goals and regulatory focus were collected. The finding (Kray et al., 2001) that women make lower salary requests than men when under stereotype threat was replicated. Women in the threat condition further reported lower aspiration salary, marginally significantly lower reservation salary and less eagerness/more vigilance than men. Reservation salary mediated the stereotype threat effect, and there was a trend for regulatory focus to mediate the effect. Thus, reservation salary partly explains why women ask for less salary than men under stereotype threat. Female negotiators may benefit from learning that stereotype threat causes sex-differences in motivation.","collectionName":"Scandinavian Journal of Psychology","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"salari":65.77123797731817,"threat":54.827200895458155,"stereotyp":43.853440382803214,"man":27.403742832268865,"reserv":21.925887638583532,"negoti":21.924638484354883,"woman":21.922838169269358,"krai":10.965440179091631,"al":10.963360095700803,"vigil":5.482720089545816,"eager":5.482720089545816,"told":5.482720089545816,"reservat":5.482720089545816,"manipulat":5.482720089545816,"aspirat":5.482720089545816,"wa":5.482026848616839,"sex":5.481680047850402,"confer":5.481680047850402,"aspir":5.481680047850402,"request":5.481680047850402,"student":5.481101779170666,"busi":5.481017639498762,"condition":5.480986085296529,"trend":5.480916662546665,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"abil":5.48084723497695}},{"id":"56629529-9d9b-33a8-9597-9572186b0844","title":"Ceilings or floors?

For highly educated workers, in line with the conventional glass ceiling hypothesis, the gap increases as we move up the distribution. However, for less-educated workers the gap decreases.

Quantile wage regressions were used to study whether a glass ceiling effect exits at the firm level. The difference between the male and female wage distributions is also decomposed into two components, one due to differences in labour market characteristics between men and women and one due to differences in rewards to these individual characteristics. \nFindings \n- It was found that the gender wage gap measured through OLS is quite low, less than 8 per cent when controlling for age, experience, qualification and location. It remains rather flat along the wage distribution, a result which casts doubt on the glass ceiling theory. The gender gap is mainly due to differences in labour market characteristics rather than to differences in the rewards of these characteristics, especially among executives. Finally, women face a lower probability of reaching higher hierarchical positions within the firm. \nResearch limitations/implications \n- Taking into account firm effects matters when measuring the magnitude of the gender wage throughout the wage gap distribution. \nOriginality/value \n- This paper presents original estimates of the gender wage gap with an unusual, firm-based sample of workers.","collectionName":"International Journal of Manpower","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2008"},"index":4,"keywords":{"wage":54.808200663548945,"gap":32.88502389815525,"gender":32.884527944311735,"firm":27.40550889585333,"distribut":21.923944341186115,"glass":21.92366665018666,"ceil":21.923597224424494,"labour":10.963360095700803,"reward":10.963360095700803,"market":10.961674632718415,"woman":10.961419084634679,"cent":5.482720089545816,"defenc":5.482720089545816,"ol":5.482720089545816,"executif":5.482026848616839,"qualif":5.482026848616839,"probabl":5.482026848616839,"doubt":5.482026848616839,"aerospac":5.482026848616839,"tail":5.482026848616839,"magnitud":5.481680047850402,"face":5.481680047850402,"exit":5.481680047850402,"matter":5.481333126771467,"employe":5.4812339843533024,"relev":5.4812339843533024,"worker":5.481055503227208,"compon":5.481055503227208,"compani":5.480916662546665,"locat":5.4808839913495895,"experi":5.480748566453773,"man":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"8c4effce-8c98-3aaf-87ca-04b33caa8e33","title":"A note on the gender wage gap among managerial positions using a counterfactual decomposition approach: sticky floor or glass ceiling?","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/note-gender-wage-gap-among-managerial-positions-using-counterfactual-decomposition-approach-sticky-f/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/note-gender-wage-gap-among-managerial-positions-using-counterfactual-decomposition-approach-sticky-f/","creator":"Marco Biagetti, Sergio Scicchitano","description":"In this article, we apply a counterfactual decomposition approach using Quantile Regression (QR) to the wage distribution of managerial workforce in Italy.

Results from three-level hierarchical linear models, estimated on a unique nested data set drawn from the 2000 Census, suggest that greater representation of women in management does narrow the gender wage gap. Model predictions show, however, that the presence of high-status female managers has a much larger impact on gender wage inequality. We conclude that the promotion of women into management positions may benefit all women, but only if female managers reach relatively high-status positions.","collectionName":"American Sociological Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"manag":32.88475939454032,"gender":32.884527944311735,"woman":21.922838169269358,"statu":16.443701953059907,"inequ":16.442878154427728,"wage":16.442460199064683,"high":10.962467968706605,"gap":10.961674632718415,"affect":5.482720089545816,"managers":5.482720089545816,"largescal":5.482720089545816,"nonmanageri":5.482720089545816,"censu":5.481680047850402,"priction":5.481471909645883,"access":5.4812339843533024,"offer":5.481101779170666,"worker":5.481055503227208,"promotion":5.481055503227208,"presenc":5.481017639498762,"glass":5.480916662546665,"ceil":5.4808993061061235,"job":5.4808993061061235,"benefit":5.4808839913495895,"impact":5.480782591182193}},{"id":"9b0ae1b0-7250-3272-b56b-c73d604f43d6","title":"Has the 'Glass Ceiling' Cracked?

Ultimately, women initiated organizations define the women's movement of the 21st century.","collectionName":"Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"woman":27.403547711586697,"entrepreneurship":16.448160268637448,"world":10.961455143789724,"st":5.482720089545816,"goodby":5.482720089545816,"favor":5.482720089545816,"offshoot":5.482720089545816,"ladder":5.482026848616839,"stress":5.482026848616839,"gla":5.481680047850402,"rise":5.481159621088721,"organ":5.481101779170666,"path":5.480916662546665,"glass":5.480916662546665,"job":5.4808993061061235,"movem":5.4808993061061235,"ceil":5.4808993061061235,"workforc":5.480799166912561,"chang":5.480793232423387}},{"id":"549f29df-b80d-3f5c-a716-db89088b3810","title":"A Meta-Analysis of the International Gender Wage Gap","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/metaanalysis-international-gender-wage-gap/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/metaanalysis-international-gender-wage-gap/","creator":"Doris Weichselbaumer, Rudolf Winter-Ebmer","description":"Since the early 1970s, a number of authors have calculated gender wage differentials between women and men of equal productivity. This meta-study provides a new quantitative review of this vast amount of empirical literature on gender wage differentials as it concerns not only differences in methodology, data, and time periods, but also different countries. We place particular emphasis on a proper consideration of the quality of the underlying study which is done by a weighting with quality indicators. The results show that data restrictions – i.e. the limitation of the analysis to new entrants, never-marrieds, or one narrow occupation only – have the biggest impact on the resulting gender wage gap. Moreover, we are able to show what effect a misspecification of the underlying wage equation – like the frequent use of potential experience – has on the calculated gender wage gap. Over time, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially; however, most of this decrease is due to better labor market endowments of females.","collectionName":"Journal of Economic Surveys","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"wage":38.36574046448426,"gender":27.403773286926448,"differenti":16.44441572893765,"gap":16.442511949077623,"meta":10.965440179091631,"qualiti":10.961798612212247,"time":10.961515927750867,"endow":5.482720089545816,"marri":5.482720089545816,"never":5.482720089545816,"misspecif":5.482720089545816,"restrict":5.482026848616839,"entrant":5.482026848616839,"consider":5.481680047850402,"femal":5.481680047850402,"equat":5.481680047850402,"concern":5.481680047850402,"emphasi":5.481471909645883,"decreas":5.481333126771467,"occup":5.481333126771467,"intern":5.4812339843533024,"place":5.481101779170666,"labor":5.481017639498762,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"market":5.4808373163592075,"impact":5.480782591182193,"man":5.480748566453773,"experi":5.480748566453773,"product":5.480725725130163,"woman":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"0c6d6403-cda7-3705-90dd-c9647645ead6","title":"Women Entrepreneurs: Moving Beyond the Glass Ceiling.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-entrepreneurs-moving-beyond-glass-ceiling/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-entrepreneurs-moving-beyond-glass-ceiling/","creator":"C.

Using hierarchical linear models, the analysis combines individual-level data (obtained from the Luxembourg Income Study) with country-level data (obtained from secondary sources) to evaluate the effects of family policies on gender earnings inequality across 20 advanced societies. The analysis shows that gender earnings disparities are less pronounced in countries with developed family policies. However, the findings also show that if cross-country differences in the wage structure are controlled, the underlying effect of family policy on the gender gap is exposed. Although “mother-friendly” policies enable more women to become economically active, they exacerbate gender occupational inequality. The authors therefore conclude that the lower earnings differentials between men and women in developed welfare states should be attributed to their more egalitarian wage structures rather than to their family policies.","collectionName":"American Sociological Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2005"},"index":4,"keywords":{"polici":38.36586121451445,"gender":27.403773286926448,"earning":21.924407116682666,"inequ":16.442878154427728,"structur":16.442611134107306,"wage":16.442460199064683,"gap":10.961674632718415,"countri":10.961674632718415,"woman":10.961419084634679,"friendli":5.482720089545816,"luxembourg":5.482720089545816,"friendly":5.482720089545816,"study":5.482720089545816,"sources":5.482720089545816,"welfar":5.482026848616839,"uncov":5.482026848616839,"attain":5.482026848616839,"dispar":5.482026848616839,"family":5.482026848616839,"country":5.481680047850402,"cross":5.481680047850402,"individual":5.481680047850402,"mother":5.481471909645883,"differenti":5.481471909645883,"incom":5.481159621088721,"women":5.481159621088721,"societi":5.481017639498762,"man":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"36c960f1-4602-3923-92be-0b29054ba396","title":"Gender wage gaps, 'sticky floors' and 'glass ceilings' in Europe","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-wage-gaps-sticky-floors-glass-ceilings-europe/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-wage-gaps-sticky-floors-glass-ceilings-europe/","creator":"Louis N.

The size of the gender wage gap varies considerably across countries, definitions of the gap, and selection-correction mechanisms. Most of the gap cannot be explained by the characteristics available in this data set. Quantile regressions show that, in a number of countries, the wage gap is wider at the top ('glass ceilings') and/or at the bottom of the wage distribution ('sticky floors'). We find larger mean/median gender gaps and more evidence of glass ceilings for full-time full-year employees, suggesting more female disadvantage in 'better' jobs. These features may be related to country-specific policies that cannot be evaluated at the individual-country level, at a point in time. We use the cross-country variation in the unexplained wage gaps of this larger-than-usual sample of states to explore the influence of (i) country policies that reconcile work and family life and (ii) their wage-setting institutions. We find that country policies and institutions are related to features of their unexplained gender wage gaps in systematic, quantitatively important, ways.","collectionName":"Labour Economics","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2013"},"index":4,"keywords":{"gap":49.327535847232866,"countri":38.36586121451445,"wage":38.36574046448426,"gender":27.403773286926448,"glass":16.442749987639996,"ceil":16.44269791831837,"polici":16.442511949077623,"floor":10.962467968706605,"institut":10.962319242177442,"featur":10.961767982699179,"than":5.482720089545816,"usu":5.482720089545816,"correction":5.482720089545816,"larger":5.482720089545816,"bottom":5.482026848616839,"definit":5.482026848616839,"union":5.482026848616839,"cross":5.481680047850402,"country":5.481680047850402,"individual":5.481680047850402,"europ":5.481333126771467,"employe":5.4812339843533024,"specif":5.4812339843533024,"incom":5.481159621088721,"variat":5.481101779170666,"distribut":5.480986085296529,"condition":5.480986085296529,"influenc":5.480986085296529,"job":5.4808993061061235,"life":5.480828299348617,"time":5.480757963875433,"work":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"3a7a69a6-c58c-340a-9440-2b63cd30632f","title":"What lies beyond the glass ceiling?: The glass cliff and the potential precariousness of women's leadership positions","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/lies-beyond-glass-ceiling-glass-cliff-potential-precariousness-womens-leadership-positions/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/lies-beyond-glass-ceiling-glass-cliff-potential-precariousness-womens-leadership-positions/","creator":"Michelle   Ryan ,  Alex   Haslam ","description":"Purpose \n– This year marks the 20th anniversary of the glass ceiling, but does this metaphor fully describe the experiences of women today?

This suggests that earnings penalties for women engineers result from cohort rather than glass-ceiling effects-that the earnings penalty to women is more a matter of when they started their careers than of how long they have worked. (2) In absolute terms, the earnings penalties for younger cohorts of women are essentially zero.

Rather than the differential wage growth rates predicted by these models, she finds similar average rates of earnings growth for women and men across numerous specifications, which suggests that the gender gap in earnings is determined by factors already present early in the career. Her findings reveal slower earnings growth in only two subsets of women: young mothers, who experience slower earnings growth during the early career relative to men the same age, but then compensate with faster growth later in their careers; and women with exceptionally high earnings levels. The latter are underrepresented among workers winning the largest promotions, when compared to similarly successful men the same age, and face a glass ceiling at the very top of the career ladder.","collectionName":"Industrial and Labor Relations Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"earning":32.886610675024,"growth":32.88539583663674,"career":21.923481512143074,"man":21.922994265815092,"woman":21.922838169269358,"graduat":16.443999380314402,"colleg":16.443305337512,"glass":16.442749987639996,"ceil":16.44269791831837,"gender":16.442263972155867,"choic":10.962467968706605,"nation":10.962111006454416,"typ":5.482720089545816,"docum":5.482720089545816,"dam":5.482720089545816,"nsf":5.482026848616839,"ladder":5.482026848616839,"repres":5.481680047850402,"face":5.481680047850402,"priction":5.481471909645883,"capit":5.481471909645883,"latter":5.481471909645883,"foundat":5.481471909645883,"mother":5.481471909645883,"subset":5.481471909645883,"discrimin":5.481333126771467,"specif":5.4812339843533024,"worker":5.481055503227208,"promotion":5.481055503227208,"scienc":5.481017639498762,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"wage":5.4808200663548945,"role":5.480761464853082,"experi":5.480748566453773,"present":5.4807239537404095,"human":5.480710759842148}},{"id":"ed74ddb3-00eb-3c10-8755-03532c39591f","title":"The Glass Ceiling Effect","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/glass-ceiling-effect/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/glass-ceiling-effect/","creator":"David a Cotter, Joan M Hermsen, Seth Ovadia, Reeve Vanneman","description":"The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender (or other) disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person's career.

Thus, we should not describe all systems of differential work rewards as \"class ceilings.\" They appear to be a distinctively gender phenomenon.","collectionName":"Social Forces","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2001"},"index":4,"keywords":{"ceil":21.923597224424494,"glass":16.442749987639996,"gender":16.442263972155867,"inequ":10.961918769618485,"percentil":5.482720089545816,"criteria":5.482026848616839,"hierarchi":5.482026848616839,"or":5.481680047850402,"gla":5.481680047850402,"race":5.481680047850402,"reward":5.481680047850402,"dynamic":5.481333126771467,"incom":5.481159621088721,"earning":5.481101779170666,"class":5.481017639498762,"career":5.480870378035768,"man":5.480748566453773,"work":5.480729498950042,"woman":5.4807095423173395,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"76862d82-26e6-3f34-bfc7-fb4e5c3f34bf","title":"Twenty years later: explaining the persistence of the glass ceiling for women leaders","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/twenty-years-later-explaining-persistence-glass-ceiling-women-leaders/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/twenty-years-later-explaining-persistence-glass-ceiling-women-leaders/","creator":"Birgit  Weyer","description":"Purpose \n– The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide a theoretical explanation for the persistence of the glass ceiling keeping women from assuming leadership positions. \nDesign/methodology/approach \n– The methodological approach of this paper is to compare and contrast social role theory and expectation states theory as theoretical underpinnings to explain the persistence of a glass ceiling for women leaders. \nFindings \n– Both social role theory and expectation states theory belong to the structural/cultural models describing differences between the genders. Social role theory and expectation states theory explicate diverse reasons for the emergence of these differences. However, both theories propose that gender differences will result in evaluation bias against women. \nPractical implications \n– As a result of evaluation bias against women, the glass ceiling phenomenon keeping women from assuming top leadership positions continues to occur. \nOriginality/value \n– This paper is being written on the 20 year anniversary of the term glass ceiling being coined. It adds to the body of literature by closely examining two structural/cultural theories as possible causes to an invisible barrier which keeps women leaders from entering top level management positions.","collectionName":"Women In Management Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"woman":38.364966796221374,"glass":27.404583312733326,"ceil":27.40449653053062,"leader":16.446080545850517,"persist":16.445040143551203,"expect":16.443701953059907,"social":16.442511949077623,"role":16.442284394559245,"leadership":10.964053697233679,"bia":10.962943819291766,"gender":10.961509314770579,"underpinning":5.482720089545816,"twenti":5.482720089545816,"explic":5.482720089545816,"emerg":5.482026848616839,"anniversari":5.482026848616839,"barrier":5.481333126771467,"contrast":5.481159621088721,"bodi":5.481101779170666,"manag":5.480793232423387}},{"id":"7549fff5-5158-32b9-9606-e410b5830528","title":"The glass ceiling in Europe: Why are women doing badly in the labour market?","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/glass-ceiling-europe-women-doing-badly-labour-market/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/glass-ceiling-europe-women-doing-badly-labour-market/","creator":"Alison L.

More recently studies have begun to explore the degree to which observed gender wage gaps might differ across the wages distribution. The stylised facts from these studies, summarised in the first part of the paper, are that the gender pay gap in Europe is typically increasing across the wages distribution. This finding - more pronounced in the private than the public sector - has been interpreted as a glass ceiling effect. The existence of this glass ceiling suggests that the average gender pay gap in Europe is mainly due to the gender gap towards the top of the wages distribution. What explains these stylised facts? We briefly outline some relevant hypotheses in the second part of the paper. A fundamental challenge for labour economists is to identify the extent to which these stylised facts are due to policies and institutions, discrimination, to other unobservable factors, or to fundamental differences between men and women. Finally, we briefly summarise the policy initiatives that might be introduced to deal with gender wage gaps.","collectionName":"Swedish Economic Policy Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2007"},"index":4,"keywords":{"gap":32.88502389815525,"gender":32.884527944311735,"wage":27.404100331774472,"europ":16.443999380314402,"distribut":16.442958255889586,"glass":16.442749987639996,"ceil":16.44269791831837,"labour":10.963360095700803,"economist":10.963360095700803,"polici":10.961674632718415,"woman":10.961419084634679,"unobserv":5.482720089545816,"averag":5.482720089545816,"outlin":5.482026848616839,"summaris":5.482026848616839,"exist":5.481680047850402,"discrimin":5.481333126771467,"institut":5.481159621088721,"initi":5.481101779170666,"interest":5.481017639498762,"extent":5.480986085296529,"market":5.4808373163592075,"man":5.480748566453773}},{"id":"ae2e2d28-0ac0-315b-8bd1-9055eaebc17d","title":"Gender gap in the executive suite: CEOs and female executives report on breaking the glass ceiling.","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-gap-executive-suite-ceos-female-executives-report-breaking-glass-ceiling/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gender-gap-executive-suite-ceos-female-executives-report-breaking-glass-ceiling/","creator":"B.

Using samples of working-age couples in 21 countries we employ multilevel modeling to separate the effects of household and country-level variables on earnings. We distinguish two types of relevant contextual factors: those that support women's employment while preserving their domestic roles and those that potentially reduce intra-family economic inequalities by allowing women to allocate more of their time to paid employment. The findings suggest that all employment-supportive policies and arrangements increase women's relative contribution to the household income through their effect on female labor force participation. Among dual-earner families, however, higher rates of childcare facilities increase women's contribution, while long maternity leave and part-time employment decrease it. These tendencies are more pronounced among mothers. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Salvanes, John van Reenen","description":"There has been a remarkable increase in wage inequality in the United States, UK, and many other countries over the past three decades. A significant part of this appears to be within observable groups (such as experience-gender-skill cells). A generally untested implication of many theories rationalizing the growth of within-group inequality is that firm-level productivity dispersion should also have increased. We utilize a UK firm-level panel dataset covering the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors since the early 1980s. We find evidence that productivity inequality has increased. Existing studies have typically underestimated this phenomenon because they focus only on the manufacturing sector where inequality has risen much less and which has shrunk rapidly. Most of the increase in individual wage inequality can be accounted for by an increase in inequality between firms (and within industries). Increased productivity dispersion appears to be linked with new technologies as suggested by models such as Caselli (1999, Am. Econ. Rev., 89, 78-102) and is not primarily due to an increase in transitory shocks, greater sorting or entry/exit dynamics.","collectionName":"Industrial and Corporate Change","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"inequ":38.3667156936647,"increas":21.923481512143074,"product":21.92290290052065,"firm":16.443305337512,"wage":16.442460199064683,"dispers":10.964053697233679,"uk":10.962943819291766,"experience":5.482720089545816,"econ":5.482720089545816,"am":5.482720089545816,"cells":5.482720089545816,"shock":5.482720089545816,"caselli":5.482720089545816,"rev":5.482720089545816,"industries":5.482720089545816,"skil":5.482720089545816,"exit":5.481680047850402,"entri":5.481471909645883,"dynamic":5.481333126771467,"evolut":5.481333126771467,"dataset":5.481055503227208,"growth":5.4808993061061235,"countri":5.4808373163592075,"gender":5.480754657385289,"technologi":5.480738124770573}},{"id":"0d81c28a-a891-3da9-b19d-d4718cdf0f76","title":"Changes in wage-and-salary returns to skill and the recent rise in female self-employment","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/changes-wageandsalary-returns-skill-recent-rise-female-selfemployment/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/changes-wageandsalary-returns-skill-recent-rise-female-selfemployment/","creator":"T.

This trend raises an obvious question, namely, what was happening to female earnings opportunities in self-employment, relative to earnings opportunities in wage-and-salary employment? Findings presented in this paper indicate the following: self-employment increased more for females who faced increasing potential earnings in wage-and-salary employment, suggesting that returns to skill were increasing by even more in self-employment; increasing relative returns to skill may explain at least part of the recent rise in female self-employment; there is an absence of a sharp difference in self-employment rates between women in the top and middle segments of the skill distribution: women with relatively low skill levels who faced declining real wages in wage-and-salary employment did not turn to self-employment in the same proportions as women with higher skill levels. Results presented here suggest that the recent rise in female self-employment may have added to the increasing earnings inequality that has been documented previously for females in wage-and-salary employment, a finding that is clearly worth further investigation. -from Author","collectionName":"American Economic Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1994"},"index":4,"keywords":{"employ":65.77123797731817,"skill":32.887403906119815,"wage":32.88492039812937,"salari":27.404682490549238,"earning":21.924407116682666,"femal":16.445040143551203,"rise":16.44347886326616,"woman":16.44212862695202,"opportun":10.961872996219695,"trend":10.96183332509333,"middl":5.482720089545816,"someon":5.482720089545816,"proport":5.482720089545816,"from":5.481680047850402,"absenc":5.481680047850402,"segment":5.481471909645883,"labor":5.481017639498762,"distribut":5.480986085296529,"inequ":5.480959384809243,"increas":5.480870378035768,"market":5.4808373163592075,"chang":5.480793232423387,"work":5.480729498950042,"real":5.480725725130163}},{"id":"442f9c92-8f3f-3d77-9e95-3121c5423c6f","title":"Women, War, and Wages: The Effect of Female Labor Supply on the Wage Structure at Midcentury","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-war-wages-effect-female-labor-supply-wage-structure-midcentury-15/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/women-war-wages-effect-female-labor-supply-wage-structure-midcentury-15/","creator":"Daron Acemoglu, David H.

The evidence was that wages of college graduates were high and rising relative to wages of high-school graduates. Last year Newsweek bemoaned increasing inequality pointing to the low and falling wages of high-school graduates relative to college graduates. The study of wages has been the primary occupation of economists since Adam (Smith, 1776), but the subject has never drawn more attention than it does now. We first trace 1963-1990 trends in wage dispersion among men. We then follow relative wage movements among men distinguished by age and education, between men and women, and between blacks and whites. These two sets of patterns, inequality and relative wages, constitute the basic facts that have drawn so much attention. After summarizing them, we describe the coincident magnification of inequality that has resulted from increasing covariance between wages and time works and between ages of married men and the employment and earnings of their spouses. The magnification that we see for men is even greater for women because growth in participation has covaried more strongly with education.","collectionName":"The American Economic Review","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"1993"},"index":4,"keywords":{"wage":49.32738059719405,"man":27.403742832268865,"graduat":21.92533250708587,"inequ":21.92383753923697,"colleg":16.443305337512,"magnif":10.965440179091631,"school":10.962943819291766,"high":10.962467968706605,"educ":10.961972170593057,"attent":10.961872996219695,"woman":10.961419084634679,"newsweek":5.482720089545816,"covari":5.482720089545816,"white":5.482720089545816,"adam":5.482720089545816,"page":5.482720089545816,"black":5.482720089545816,"smith":5.482720089545816,"wall":5.482720089545816,"spou":5.482720089545816,"journal":5.482720089545816,"dispers":5.482026848616839,"street":5.482026848616839,"trace":5.481680047850402,"economist":5.481680047850402,"front":5.481680047850402,"occup":5.481333126771467,"subject":5.481101779170666,"earning":5.481101779170666,"employ":5.480936498109847,"trend":5.480916662546665,"movem":5.4808993061061235,"growth":5.4808993061061235,"time":5.480757963875433,"work":5.480729498950042}},{"id":"c700fc3e-20a5-38ab-b05a-b7d8803a4f44","title":"The Ideal Worker or the Ideal Father: Organizational Structures and Culture in the Gendered University","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/ideal-worker-ideal-father-organizational-structures-culture-gendered-university/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/research/ideal-worker-ideal-father-organizational-structures-culture-gendered-university/","creator":"Margaret W.

Using theories of gendered organizations as a guide, this article draws on interviews with 70 faculty fathers at four research universities to explore the tension that many men feel navigating their responsibilities in the home while simultaneously aiming to fulfill the norms of the ideal worker, which holds that employees are always available to perform work and have few responsibilities in the home. Data suggest that institutions and those within them penalize men who appear too committed to their families. Some participants crafted identities for themselves that separated their roles as professor and father while others struggled to reconcile their two roles. In short, institutional structures and culture play a critical role in shaping faculty identity, both on and off-campus.","collectionName":"Research in Higher Education","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2012"},"index":4,"keywords":{"structur":21.923481512143074,"father":16.445040143551203,"cultur":16.44441572893765,"home":16.443052918496285,"role":16.442284394559245,"man":16.44224569936132,"faculti":10.964053697233679,"ident":10.963360095700803,"ideal":10.962943819291766,"univers":10.962319242177442,"worker":10.962111006454416,"tension":5.482026848616839,"guid":5.481680047850402,"campu":5.481680047850402,"professor":5.481471909645883,"interview":5.481471909645883,"off":5.481471909645883,"famili":5.481471909645883,"norm":5.481333126771467,"employe":5.4812339843533024,"institut":5.481159621088721,"organ":5.481101779170666,"workplac":5.481101779170666,"work":5.480729498950042,"woman":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"acecf5b8-b8c2-3b54-8270-ce36d175ca2f","title":"The Origins of the Ideal Worker: The Separation of Work and Home in the United States From the Market Revolution to 1950","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/origins-ideal-worker-separation-work-home-united-states-market-revolution-1950/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/origins-ideal-worker-separation-work-home-united-states-market-revolution-1950/","creator":"a.

By the 1950s, the office culture familiar today was well established—movies, television, and novels glorified the gendered system of professional work while also cautioning men to reserve time for family. Although the workforce has transformed since the 1950s, an ideology that naturalizes work/home separation persists.","collectionName":"Work and Occupations","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2014"},"index":4,"keywords":{"work":27.40364749475021,"home":21.924070557995048,"separ":16.445040143551203,"offic":10.962943819291766,"ideal":10.962943819291766,"worker":10.962111006454416,"market":10.961674632718415,"ideologi":5.482720089545816,"televis":5.482720089545816,"movi":5.482720089545816,"which":5.482720089545816,"established":5.482720089545816,"naturaliz":5.482720089545816,"revolut":5.482720089545816,"factori":5.482026848616839,"histori":5.482026848616839,"th":5.481680047850402,"cultur":5.481471909645883,"mix":5.481471909645883,"reserv":5.481471909645883,"norm":5.481333126771467,"standard":5.481333126771467,"growth":5.4808993061061235,"workforc":5.480799166912561,"time":5.480757963875433,"man":5.480748566453773,"technologi":5.480738124770573,"product":5.480725725130163,"system":5.480689735059184}},{"id":"c21d9486-20c8-3d04-9f63-d954de637ba1","title":"Gendered Challenge, Gendered Response: Confronting the Ideal Worker Norm in a White-Collar Organization","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gendered-challenge-gendered-response-confronting-ideal-worker-norm-whitecollar-organization/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/gendered-challenge-gendered-response-confronting-ideal-worker-norm-whitecollar-organization/","creator":"E.

We address two research questions: How does this initiative attempt to change the masculinized ideal worker norm? And what do women's and men's responses reveal about the persistent ways that gender structures work and family life? Data demonstrate the ideal worker norm is pervasive and powerful, even as employees begin critically examining expectations regarding work time that have historically privileged men. Employees' responses to ROWE are also gendered. Women (especially mothers) are more enthusiastic, while men are more cautious. Ambivalence about and resistance to change is expressed in different ways depending on gender and occupational status.","collectionName":"Gender & Society","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2010"},"index":4,"keywords":{"work":21.92291799580017,"norm":16.443999380314402,"organ":16.443305337512,"initi":16.443305337512,"worker":16.443166509681625,"man":16.44224569936132,"respon":10.964053697233679,"employe":10.962467968706605,"chang":10.961586464846773,"gender":10.961509314770579,"woman":10.961419084634679,"headquart":5.482720089545816,"row":5.482720089545816,"critiqu":5.482720089545816,"resist":5.482720089545816,"mothers":5.482720089545816,"rowe":5.482720089545816,"ambival":5.482720089545816,"ideal":5.481471909645883,"inc":5.481471909645883,"cultur":5.481471909645883,"statu":5.4812339843533024,"expect":5.4812339843533024,"workplac":5.481101779170666,"individu":5.481055503227208,"interfac":5.480936498109847,"structur":5.480870378035768,"polici":5.4808373163592075,"life":5.480828299348617,"time":5.480757963875433,"environ":5.4807095423173395}},{"id":"4e646a6c-af00-3103-9141-663a185f2780","title":"Fertility and Women's Employment in Industrialized Nations","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/fertility-womens-employment-industrialized-nations/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/fertility-womens-employment-industrialized-nations/","creator":"Karin L.

Even so, women’s labor force behavior lies at the heart of most explanations of fertility and fertility change, and many nations, both industrialized and developing, have formulated policies based on the inverse association between these two central aspects of women’s lives. The association between fertility and women’s labor force activity reflects the incompatibility between caring for children and participating in economically productive work that typifies industrialized societies (Weller 1977). Prior to industrialization, work and child rearing tasks could be performed more or less simultaneously. In historical and contemporary preindustrial societies, nonmechanized agricultural tasks and piecework could be combined with child supervision with relatively little danger to the child or marked loss of economic productivity (Degler 1980, Roos 1985, Stycos &Weller 1967). As industrialization proceeded, however, childcare and economically productive work became increasingly incompatible. Today, work sites are usually some distance from home, and work schedules, set by employers, lack the flexibility required by children.

The short answer is no. Among the high potentials we studied, more than half of both women and men had adopted the full range of advancement strategies attributed to an ideal worker. Furthermore, half of those exemplifying an ideal worker were also including in their repertories external scanning activities - seeking advancement opportunities whether in their current organization or elsewhere-. However, men benefited more than women when they adopted the proactive strategies of the proverbial ideal worker. Even when women used the same career advancement strategies - doing all the things they have been told will help them get ahead - they advanced less than their male counterparts and had slower pay growth.","collectionName":"Catalyst","facets":{"provider":"mendeley","type":"unkown","language":"unkown","year":"2011"},"index":4,"keywords":{"worker":27.40527751613604,"man":27.403742832268865,"woman":27.403547711586697,"advanc":21.924638484354883,"proactiv":10.965440179091631,"thing":10.963360095700803,"ideal":10.962943819291766,"opportun":10.961872996219695,"career":10.961740756071537,"elsewhere":5.482720089545816,"things":5.482720089545816,"repertori":5.482720089545816,"myth":5.482026848616839,"potenti":5.482026848616839,"aspir":5.481680047850402,"counterpart":5.481680047850402,"answer":5.481333126771467,"organ":5.481101779170666,"growth":5.4808993061061235,"activ":5.4808373163592075,"gap":5.4808373163592075,"gender":5.480754657385289}},{"id":"2cd6ab68-5baf-313b-85d1-da00e01c5ac2","title":"Workforce planning and workplace management","uri":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/workforce-planning-workplace-management/","eexcessURI":"http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/workforce-planning-workplace-management/","creator":"L O'Brien-Pallas, S Birch, G T Murphy","description":"Introduction. Literature is scarce on father attendance to labour and delivery and studies report conflicting results. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of father attendance during labour and delivery on pain, anxiety, stress and other variables (irritability, feeling of inefficiency, agitation, worry, lack of self-confidence and ability to relax) perceived by parturient. Methods. An only post-test quasi-experimental design was used. The sample consisted of 200 women in labour. One hundred women (experimental group) were cared for by their partners in the labour and delivery room; another one hundred (control group) were cared for only by the health professionals. Pain, anxiety, stress and other variables were measured using scales of proven validity and reliability. Results. The parturients of the experimental group had a significantly lower pain, anxiety and stress perception than those of the control group. The parturients of the experimental group were also less irritable, agitated, worried, felt more efficient, self-confident and able to relax. Conclusion. The results of this study confirmed part of the literature on the positive effects of father attendance at labour and delivery. This study also contributed to raise major awareness among the health professionals and hospital managers where the control group was recruited on the importance of the support that partners can provide to parturients. Introduction. The spread of palliative care calls for a careful training of the increasing number of health professionals providing assistance to terminally ill patients and their families. One of the skills needed to improve these patients' quality of life is to develop positive attitudes to-wards end-of-life assistance. Among the various tools that assess training needs and efficacy of training programs, the Frommelt Attitude Toward Care of the Dying Scale (FACTOD Form B ) is an effective and reliable instrument, widely used to analyze this type of attitude among nursing students and health professionals. The aim of the article is to verify the Italian Version (FACTOD Form B-I ), so as to spread the use of these tools also to the palliative care field of our country. Methods. The instrument validation has been developed through the following stages: forward and backward translation, focus groups to assess questions' relevance and vocabulary comprehension, test and retest on a sample of Medicine and Nursing students. Results. The statistical analysis has showed an Interrater Correlation Index between 0.70 and 0.86 for 97% of the items. As for the discriminating capacity, the scale presents good values of asymmetry and kurtosis for most of the items. The internal consistency (Cronbach's Alpha) is 0.83. On average, the questionnaire has been completed in six minutes and the compilation has been rather easy. Conclusions. FACTOD Form B-I results as a comprehensible instrument, fast and practical to complete, with good psychometric proper-ties, showed by very good values of reproducibility and reliability of the whole scale. Its use in Italy is, therefore, recommended to evaluate the attitude of students and healthcare professionals who take care of terminally ill patients. Introduction. The nursing care based on a delicate balance between \"science of nature\" and \"science of spirit\" can be a powerful antidote to individualism of our own modern society. The feeling of confidence/trust, expressed through a variety of languages (verbal, gestural, bodily) can start a meeting, a relationship, to discover and go beyond the unknown side, that both the patient and the nurse have. Issue. The article is going to analyse the feeling of trust and link it, in particular, to the activity of nursing care. In the first part trust is analysed from a sociological point of view, taking into consideration some of the ideas of Georg Simmel and Niklas Lhumann. A trustful attitude always rises, develops and is verified in set units of time and place, starting from the potential the interlocutors show. In the second part of the article, through the nursing remarks by Jean Watson, the presence of trust as a constituent element in the professional acting is analysed. According to the author, trust is a condition that facilitates the relationship of care, opens the way for the dialogue, encouraging the relationship. Conclusions. The trust is an important feeling in interpersonal relationship. Caring practices, woven into daily technical gestures and always acted through a relationship, need to experiment trust to be effective and consent the realization of a caring project. The trust can't be claimed, it can only be offered or accepted, beginning from a decision in a relationship and people that receive it take an opportunity. Introduction. Therapeutic Touch is an energy-based nursing practice, inside Nursing Interventions Classification , linked with NANDA nursing diagnosis of \"Energy field disturbance\". Introduced and developed by Dolores Krieger, Nursing emeritus professor at the New York University, and Dora Kunz, pranotherapist, today is practiced at nursing in more than eighty hospitals in the world, and more than 43,000 nurses are trained in Therapeutic Touch. Problem. Therapeutic Touch is based on the energy techniques, practiced over the centuries in different continents, on quantum physics, and in the nursing theory, on work by Martha Rogers, the Science of Unitarian Human Beings. In the USA, the Therapeutic Touch, has the scientific and professional support by American Nurses Association and the American Holistic Nurses Association. The scientific evidence seem to indicate that the psychosomatic effects of the Therapeutic Touch, are not only attributable to a placebo effect, but to a direct action of the Therapeutic Touch on an human being energy field, with effects of rebalancing on the energy field configuration. Conclusions. Nurses trained in Therapeutic Touch must develop a very open mind, have a holistic understanding of the human being and reality, and develope consciousness states and a transcendental awareness. Introduction. Anxiety and depression in patients before and after a pacemaker implantation has been understudied despite an increased use of pacemaker therapy in Italy and in the world. The purpose of the present study was to describe and examine anxiety and depression and factors associated with them before a pacemaker implantation and within one year of the post implantation time. Methods. A descriptive, correlational and comparative design has been used to study and compare anxiety and depression in a total sample of 154 patients from two hospitals in Rome, Italy, divided in four groups: 43 patients before the pacemaker implantation, and 38, 29 and 44 patients respectively one, six and twelve months after the implantation. A Sociodemographic Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale have been used to measure the study variables. Results. Anxiety and depression significantly decreased from the pre to the post implantation groups. In the 1-month-post-implantation group patients with a ventricular pacing had lower anxiety and depression levels than those with dual chamber pacing. In the 6-month-post-implantation group patients with a rate responsive pacing were more depressed than those without rate responsive pacing. People less old, less educated, with lower income and fewer children were more anxious and depressed before the implantation. Only older people were more depressed after the implantation. Conclusion. This study provides nurses with a first overview on the phenomenon of anxiety and depression before and after a pacemaker implantation. Knowing the level of anxiety and depression before and after a pacemaker implantation as well as factors associated with these variables helps nurses to provide patients with a better and research based care. Introduction. Those of the urinary tract are the most commonly acquired infections in hospitals. Their prevention is based on the use of indwelling catheters only when a clear clinical indication emerges. The goal of this research is to evaluate the ap ropriateness of the nursing actions commonly used in hospitals to manage the need of urinary elimination in the patients. Methods. Our sample included 200 medical records of people hospitalized in a medical ward during September 2006. The sampling technique was based on the admission date; we used a modified version of Brennan's evaluation scale. Results. 4 medical records have been excluded from the analysis. The mean value of our patients' ages was 74.3 years (SD 15.4). 27 patients (13.8%) had developed some type of infection. Our analysis pointed out that catheters were appropriately used in 95.1% of the sample (39 patients) during their hospitalization, and in two over 16 at the admission. Diapers were used incorrectly in 40 patients (63.4%). Bedpans were correctly used in 41 people (77.3%). Discussion. As regards the need of urinary elimination, the mean age is different between self-sufficient patients and people who use catheters, diapers and/or bedpans. Moreover, we found a difference between the two genders: the percentage of self-sufficient patients is higher among men. Women were using devices more often than men. The highest percentage of incorrectly used devices refers to diapers, with several clinical and social consequences. Introduction. Diabetes mellitus has considerable social impact for its invalidating complications and dramatic outcomes. The prevalence range of foot ulcers in diabetic patients is 4% to 10%. The aim of this paper is to clarify if Clinical Pathway can improve clinical outcomes in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Methods. The Medline and Cinahl databases were searched for articles published between January 1997 and December 2007. Key words used were \"diabetic foot\", \"critical pathway\" e \"clinical protocols\".
